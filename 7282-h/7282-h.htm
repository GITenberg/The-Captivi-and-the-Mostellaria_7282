      {Supposed to have been written by Priseian the Grammarian.} <i>One</i> son

      has sold the other (<i>Alium</i>) when four years old. The father (<i>Pater</i>)
      traffics in Elean captives, only (<i>Tantum</i>) desirous that he may
      recover his son, and (<i>Et</i>) among these he buys his son that was
      formerly lost. He (<i>Is</i>), his clothes and his name changed with his
      master, causes that (<i>Ut</i>) he is lost <i>to Hegio</i>; <i>and</i> he
      himself is punished. And (<i>Et</i>) he brings back the captive and the
      runaway together, through whose information (<i>Indicio</i>) he discovers
      his other.

    <h2>
      THE PROLOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      These two captives (<i>pointing to</i> PHILOCRATES <i>and</i> TYNDARUS),
      whom you see standing here, are standing here because&mdash;they are both
      {1} standing, <i>and</i> are not sitting. That I am saying this truly, you
      are my witnesses. The old man, who lives here (<i>pointing to</i> HEGIO's
      <i>house</i>), is Hegio&mdash;his father (<i>pointing to</i> TYNDARUS).
      But under what circumstances he is the slave of his own father, that I
      will here explain to you, if you give attention. This old man had two
      sons; a slave stole one child when four years old, and flying hence, he
      sold him in Elis {2}, to the father of this <i>captive</i> (<i>pointing to</i>
      PHILOCRATES). Now, do you understand this? Very good. I' faith, that man
      at a distance {3} there (<i>pointing</i>) says, no. Come nearer <i>then</i>.
      If there isn't room for you to sit down, there is for you to walk; since
      you'd be compelling an actor to bawl like a beggar {4}. I'm not going to
      burst myself for your sake, <i>so</i> don't you be mistaken. You who are
      enabled by your means to pay your taxes {5}, listen to the rest {6}; I
      care not to be in debt to another. This runaway <i>slave</i>, as I said
      before, sold his <i>young</i> master, whom, when he fled, he had carried
      off, to this one's father. He, after he bought him, gave him as his own
      private slave {7} to this son of his, because they were of about the same
      age. He is now the slave at home of his own father, nor does his father
      know it. Verily, the Gods do treat us men just like footballs {8}. You
      hear the manner <i>now</i> how he lost one <i>son</i>. Afterwards, the
      Aetolians {9} are waging war with the people of Elis, <i>and</i>, as
      happens in warfare, the other son is taken prisoner. The physician
      Menarchus buys him there in Elis. <i>On this</i>, this <i>Hegio</i> begins
      to traffic in Elean captives, if, <i>perchance</i>, he may be able to find
      one to change for that captive <i>son</i> of his. He knows not that this
      one who is in his house is his own <i>son</i>. And as he heard yesterday
      that an Elean knight of very high rank and very high family was taken
      prisoner, he has spared no expense to rescue his son {10}. In order that
      he may more easily bring him back home, he buys both of these of the
      Quaestors {11} out of the spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they, between themselves, have contrived this plan, that, by means of
      it, the servant may send away hence his master home. And therefore among
      themselves they change their garments and their names. He, there (<i>pointing</i>),
      is called Philocrates; this one (<i>pointing</i>), Tyndarus; he this day
      assumes the character of this one, this one of him. And this one to-day
      will cleverly carry out this plot, and cause his master to gain his
      liberty; and by the same means he will save his own brother, and without
      knowing it, will cause him to return back a free man to his own country to
      his father, just as often now, on many occasions, a person has done more
      good unknowingly than knowingly. But unconsciously, by their devices, they
      have so planned and devised their plot, and have so contrived it by their
      design, that this one is living in servitude with his own father. <i>And</i>
      thus now, in ignorance, he is the slave of his own father. What poor
      creatures are men, when I reflect upon it! This plot will be performed by
      us&mdash;a play for your <i>entertainment</i>. But there is, besides, a
      thing which, in a few words, I would wish to inform you of. Really, it
      will be worth your while to give your attention to this play. 'Tis not
      composed in the hackneyed style, nor yet like other <i>plays</i>, nor are
      there in it any ribald lines {12} unfit for utterance: here is neither the
      perjured procurer, nor the artful courtesan, nor yet the braggart captain.
      Don't you be afraid because I've said that there's war between the
      Aetoliains and the Eleans. There (<i>pointing</i>), at a distance, beyond
      the scenes, the battles will be fought. For this were almost impossible
      for a Comic establishment{13}, that we should at a moment attempt to be
      acting Tragedy. If, therefore, any one is looking for a battle, let him
      commence the quarrel; if he shall find an adversary more powerful, I'll
      cause him to be the spectator of a battle that isn't pleasant <i>to him</i>,
      so that hereafter he shall hate to be a spectator of them all. I <i>now</i>
      retire. Fare ye well, at home, most upright judges, and in warfare most
      valiant combatants.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Because&mdash;they are both</i>)&mdash;Ver. 2. This is
      apparently intended as a piece of humour, in catching or baulking the
      audience. He begins as though he was going to explain why the captives are
      standing there, and ends his explanation with saying that they are
      standing because they are not sitting. A similar truism is uttered by
      Pamphila, in the Stichus, l. 120.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>In Elis</i>)&mdash;Ver. 9. Elis, or, as it is called by
      Plautus, "Alis," was a city of Achaia, in the north-western part of the
      Peloponnesus. Near it the Olympic games were celebrated.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>That man at a distance</i>)&mdash;Ver. 11. One of the
      audience, probably a plebeian who has no seat, but is standing in a remote
      part of the theatre, is supposed to exclaim in a rude manner that he
      cannot hear what the actor says. On this the speaker tells him that he had
      better come nearer; and if he cannot find a seat, there is room for him to
      walk away. Possibly the verb "ambulo" may be intended to signify in this
      case either "to walk" or "to stand," in contradistinction to sitting.
      Rost, with some reason, suggests "abscedito" "walk out," in place of
      "accedito," "come nearer."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>To bawl like a beggar</i>)&mdash;Ver. 13. Commentators
      have differed as to the meaning of this passage. Some think that he means
      that with the view of pleasing the plebeian part of the audience, he shall
      not bawl out like a beggar asking alms; while others suppose that the
      meaning is, that he will not run the risk of cracking his voice, after
      which he will be hissed off the stage, and so be reduced to beggary.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>To pay your taxes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 15. By this he shows
      that the party whom he is addressing, is either one of the lowest
      plebeians or a slave. In the assessment or census, which was made by the
      Censors, the slaves were not numbered at all, being supposed to have no
      "caput," or "civil condition." The lowest century were the "proletarii,"
      whose only qualification was the being heads of families, or fathers of
      children. In addressing those who are reckoned in the census "ope vestra,"
      "by your means" or "circumstances," he seems to be rebuking the
      "proletarii," who had no such standing, and who probably formed the most
      noisy part of the audience. As these paid no part of the taxes with which
      the theatres were in part supported, of course they would be placed at a
      greater distance from the stage, and probably were not accommodated with
      seats. It was just about this period that the elder Scipio assigned
      different places in the theatres to the various classes of the people.}
    </p>

      term which either signified generally, "what is left," or money borrowed
      and still unpaid. He plays upon these different meanings&mdash;"Accipite
      reliquum," which may either signify "hear the rest" or "take what is due
      and owing," and he then makes the observation, parenthetically, "alieno

      considered as though bought with his son's "peculium," or out of his own
      private purse. The "peculium" was the sum of money which a son in his
      minority was allowed by his father to be in possession of. The word also
      signified the savings of the slave.}

      and those with the "follis," which was a larger ball, inflated with air
      and struck with the hands, or used for a football. "Paganica" was a
      similar ball, but harder, being stuffed with feathers, and was used by the
      country-people. "Harpastum" was a small ball used by the Greeks, which was
      scrambled for as soon as it came to the ground, whence it received its
      name. The Greeks had a proverb similar to this expression, {Greek: Theon
      paignia anthropoi}, "men are the playthings of the Gods." So Plato called
      mankind {Greek: Theon athurmata}, "the sport of the Gods."}

      ACT I.&mdash;SCENE I.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <i>Enter</i> ERGASILUS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      ERG. The young men have given me the name of "the mistress," for this
      reason, because invocated {1} I am wont to attend at the banquet. I know
      that buffoons {2} say that this is absurdly said, but I affirm that it is
      rightly <i>said</i>. For at the banquet the lover, when he throws the
      dice, invokes his mistress.{3} Is she <i>then</i> invocated, or <i>is she</i>
      not? She is, most clearly. But, i' faith, we Parasites with better reason
      <i>are so called</i>, whom no person ever either invites or invokes, <i>and
      who</i>, like mice, are always eating the victuals of another person. When
      business is laid aside {4}, when people repair to the country, at that
      same moment is business laid aside for our teeth. Just as, when it is hot
      weather, snails lie hidden in secret, <i>and</i> live upon their own
      juices, if the dew doesn't fall; so, when business is laid aside, do
      Parasites lie hidden in retirement, <i>and</i> miserably live upon their
      own juices, while in the country the persons are rusticating whom they
      sponge upon. When business is laid aside, we Parasites are greyhounds;
      when business recommences, <i>like</i> mastiffs {5}, we are annoying-like
      and very troublesome-like {6}.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, indeed, unless, i'faith, any Parasite is able to endure cuffs
      with the fist, and pots to be broken {7} about his head, why he may e'en
      go with his wallet outside the Trigeminian Gate {8}. That this may prove
      my lot, there is some danger. For since my patron {9} has fallen into the
      hands of the enemy&mdash;(such warfare are the Aetolians now waging with
      the Eleans; for this is Aetolia; this Philopolemus has been made captive
      in Elis, the son of this old man Hegio who lives here (<i>pointing to the
      house</i>)&mdash;a house which to me is <i>a house</i> of woe, <i>and</i>
      which so oft as I look upon, I weep). Now, for the sake of his son, has he
      commenced this dishonorable traffic, very much against his own
      inclination. He buys up men that have been made captives, if <i>perchance</i>
      he may be able to find some one for whom to gain his son in exchange. An
      object which I really do much desire that he may gain, for unless he finds
      him, there's nowhere for me to find myself. I have no hopes in the young
      men; they are all <i>too</i> fond of themselves. He, in fine, is a youth
      with the old-fashioned manners, whose countenance I never rendered
      cheerful without a return. His father is worthily matched, as endowed with
      like manners. Now I'll go to him;&mdash;but his door is opening, <i>the
      door</i> from which full oft I've sallied forth drunk with excess of cheer
      (<i>He stands aside.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Because invocated</i>)&mdash;Ver. 70. "Invocatus." The
      following Note is extracted from Thornton's Translation of this Play:&mdash;
      "The reader's indulgence for the coinage of a new term (and perhaps not
      quite so much out of character from the mouth of a Parasite) is here
      requested in the use of the word 'invocated' in a sense, which it is
      owned, there is no authority for, but without it no way occurs to explain
      the poet's meaning&mdash;which, such as it is, and involved in such a pun,
      is all that can be aimed at. The word 'invocatus' means both 'called upon'
      and 'not called upon.' Ergasilus here quibbles upon it; for, though at
      entertainments be attends, as it is the common character of Parasites to
      do, without invitation, that is 'not called upon;' and as mistresses are
      'called upon' that their names so invoked may make their lovers throw the
      dice with success; still, according to the double sense of the word, they
      may be compared to each other, as they are both, according to the Latin
      idiom, 'invocati.'"}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>That buffoons</i>)&mdash;Ver. 71. "Derisores," "buffoons."
      By this word he means that particular class of Parasites who earned their
      dinners by their repartees and bon-mots.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>Invokes his mistress</i>)&mdash;Ver. 73. It was the
      Grecian custom, when they threw dice at an entertainment, for the thrower
      to call his mistress by name, which invocation was considered to bring
      good luck.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>When business is laid aside</i>)&mdash;Ver. 78. "Ubi res
      prolatae sunt." Meaning thereby "in vacation-time." In the heat of summer
      the courts of justice were closed, and the more wealthy portion of the
      Romans retired into the country or to the seaside. Cicero mentions this
      vacation as "rerum proliatio." The allusion in the previous line is
      probably derived from a saying of the Cynic Diogenes: when he saw mice
      creeping under the table, he used to say, "See the Parasites of
      Diogenes."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>Like mastiffs</i>)&mdash;Ver. 86. "Molossici." Literally,
      "dogs of Molossus," a country of Epirus.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>Annoying-like and very troublesome-like</i>)&mdash;Ver.
      87. "Odiosici&mdash;incommodestici." These are two extravagant forms of
      the words "odiosi" and "incommodi," coined by the author for the
      occasion.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 7: <i>Pots to be broken</i>)&mdash;Ver. 89. By Meursius we are
      informed that these practical jokes were played upon the unfortunate
      Parasites with pots filled with cinders, which were sometimes scattered
      over their clothes, to the great amusement of their fellow-guests.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 8: <i>The Trigeminian Gate</i>)&mdash;Ver. 90. The Ostian Gate
      was so called because the Horatii left the city by that gate to fight the
      Curiatii. The brothers being born at one birth were "trigemini," whence
      the gate received its name. The beggars with their wallets were seated
      there. See the Trinummus, 1.423, and the Note to the passage.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 9: <i>Since my patron</i>)&mdash;Ver. 92. Rex; literally,
      "king." The Parasites were in the habit of so calling their entertainers.}

    <h2>
      SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Enter, from his house, </i>HEGIO <i>and a</i> SLAVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HEG. <i>Now</i>, give attention you, if you please. Those two captives
      whom I purchased yesterday of the Quaestors out of the spoil, put upon
      them chains of light weight {1}; take of those greater ones with which
      they are bound. Permit them to walk, if they wish, out of doors, <i>or</i>
      if in-doors, but so that they are watched with the greatest care. A
      captive at liberty is like a bird that's wild; if opportunity is once
      given for escaping, 'tis enough; after that, you can never catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. Doubtless we all are free men more willingly than we live the life
      of slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. You, indeed, don't seem <i>to think</i> so {2}.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. If I have nothing to give, should you like me to give myself to
      flight {3}?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. If you do so give <i>yourself</i>, I shall at once have something to
      be giving to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. I'll make myself just like the wild bird you were telling of.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. 'Tis just as you say; for if you do so, I'll be giving you to the
      cage {4} But enough of prating; take you care of what I've ordered, and be
      off. (<i>The</i> SLAVE <i>goes into the house.</i>) I'll away to my
      brother's, to my other captives; I'll go see whether they've been making
      any disturbance last night. From there I shall forthwith betake myself
      home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. (<i>apart</i>). It grieves me that this unhappy old man is following
      the trade of a slave-dealer, by reason of the misfortune of his son. But,
      if by any means he can be brought back here, I could even endure for him
      to become an executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>overhearing him</i>). Who is it that's speaking?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. 'Tis I, who am pining at your affliction, growing thin, waxing old,
      and shockingly wasting away. Wretched man that I am, I'm <i>but</i> skin
      and bone through leanness; nor does anything ever do me good that I eat at
      home; even that ever so little which I taste out of doors, the same
      refreshes me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Ergasilus, save you! ERG. (<i>crying</i>). May the Gods kindly bless
      you, Hegio!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Don't weep. ERG. Must I not weep for him? Must I not weep for such a
      young man?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I've always known you to be a friend to my son, and I have understood
      him <i>to be so</i> to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Then at last do we men know our blessings, when we have lost those
      things which we <i>once</i> had in our power. I, since your son fell into
      the power of the enemy, knowing by experience of what value he was, now
      feel his loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Since you, who are no relation, bear his misfortune so much amiss,
      what is it likely that I, a father, should do, whose only <i>son</i> he
      is?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. I, no relation <i>to him</i>? He, no relation <i>to me</i>? Oh,
      Hegio! never do say that, nor come to such a belief. To you he is an only
      <i>child</i>, but to me he is even more only than an only one.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I commend you, in that you consider the affliction of your friend
      your own affliction. Now be of good heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. (<i>crying</i>). O dear! HEG. (<i>half-aside</i>). 'Tis this afflicts
      him, that the army for guttling is now disbanded. Meanwhile, have you
      found no one to command for you the army that you mentioned as disbanded?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. What do you think? All to whom it used to fall are in the habit of
      declining that province since your son Philopolemus was taken prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I' faith, 'tisn't to be wondered at, that they are in the habit of
      declining that province. You have necessity for numerous troops, and those
      of numerous kinds. Well, first you have need of the Bakerians {5}. Of
      these Bakerians there are several kinds. You have need of Roll-makerians,
      you hare need too of Confectionerians, you have need of Poultererians, you
      have need of Beccaficorians; besides all the maritime forces are necessary
      for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. How the greatest geniuses do frequently lie concealed! How great a
      general now is <i>this</i> private individual!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Only have good courage; for I trust that in a few days I shall bring
      him back home. For see <i>now</i>; there's a captive here, a young man of
      Elis, born of a very high family, and of very great wealth; I trust that
      it will come to pass that I shall get my son in exchange for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. May the Gods and Goddesses grant it so!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. But are you invited out anywhere to dinner?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Nowhere that I know of. But, pray, why do you ask me?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Because this is my birthday; for that reason I'd like you to be
      invited to dinner at my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. 'Tis kindly said. HEG. But if you can be content to eat a very little&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Aye, even ever so little; for on such fare as that do, I enjoy myself
      every day at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Come, <i>then</i>, please, set yourself up for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. I'll put myself up for purchase, just like a landed estate, unless
      any one shall <i>privately</i> make a better offer that pleases myself and
      my friends more, <i>and</i> to my own conditions will I bind myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. You are surely selling me a bottomless pit {6}, <i>and</i> not a
      landed estate. But if you are coming, <i>do so</i> in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Why, for that matter. I'm at leisure even now.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Go then, <i>and</i> hunt for a hare; at present, <i>in me</i> you
      have but a ferret {7}, for my fare is in the way of frequenting a rugged
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. You'll never repulse me by that, Hegio, so don't attempt it. I'll
      come, in spite of it, with teeth well shod.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Really, my viands are <i>but</i> of a rough sort {8}. ERG. Are you in
      the habit of eating brambles?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. <i>Mine</i> is an earthy dinner. ERG. A pig is an earthy animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. <i>Earthy</i> from its plenty of vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Treat your sick people {9} at home <i>with that fare?</i> Do you wish
      anything else?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Come in good time. ERG. You are putting in mind one who remembers
      quite well. (<i>Exit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I'll go in-doors, and in the house I'll make the calculation how
      little money I have at my banker's; afterwards I'll go to my brother's,
      whither I was saying I would go. (<i>Goes into his house.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Chains of light weight</i>)&mdash;Ver. 112. "Singularias"
      This word may admit of three interpretations, and it is impossible to
      decide which is the right one. It may mean chains weighting a single
      "libra," or pound; it may signify chains for the captives singly, in
      contradistiniction to those by which they were fastened to each other; or
      it may mean single chains, in opposition to double ones. In the Acts of
      the Apostles, ch. 12, v. 6, we read that St. Peter was bound with two
      chains; and in ch. 13, v. 33, the chief captain orders St. Paul to be
      bound with two chains.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Don't seem to think so</i>)&mdash;Ver. 120. Hegio means to
      say that the slave does not seem to think liberty so very desirable, or he
      would try more to please his master and do his duty, which might probably
      be the right method for gaining his liberty. As the slave could generally
      ransom himself out of his "peculium," or "savings," if they were
      sufficient, the slave here either thinks, or pretends to think, that Hegio
      is censuring him for not taking those means, and answer, accordingly, that
      he has nothing to offer}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>Give myself to flight</i>)&mdash;Ver. 121. "Dem in pedes."
      Literally, "give myself to my feet," meaning thereby "to run away." He
      puns upon this meaning of "dare," and its common signification of "to
      give" or "to offer to give."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>Giving you to the cage</i>)&mdash;Ver. 124. "In cavears."
      He plays on the word "cavea," which meaning "a cage" for a bird, might
      also mean confinement for a prisoner.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>The Bakerians</i>)&mdash;Ver. 162. This and the following
      appellations are expressive both of the several trades that contributed to
      furnishing entertainments, and, in the Latin, also denoted the names of
      inhabitants of several places in Italy or elsewhere. As this meaning could
      not be expressed in a literal translation of them, the original words are
      here subjoined. In the word "Pistorienses," he alludes to the bakers, and
      the natives of Pistorium, a town of Etruria; in the "Panicei," to the
      bread or roll bakers, and the natives of Pana, a little town of the
      Samnites, mentioned by Strabo; in the "Placentini," to the "confectioners"
      or "cake-makers," and the people of Placentia, a city in the North of
      Italy; in the "Turdetani," to the "poulterers" or "sellers of thrushes,"
      and the people of Turdentania, a district of Spain; and in the
      "Fiendulae," to the "sellers of beccaficos," a delicate bird, and the
      inhabitants of Ficculae, a town near Rome. Of course, these appellations,
      as relating to the trades, are only comical words coined for the
      occasion.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>A bottomless pit</i>)&mdash;Ver. 183. He plays upon the
      resemblance in sound of the word "fundum," "landed property," to
      "profundum," "a deep cavity," to which he compares the Parasite's stomach.
      "You sell me landed property, indeed; say rather a bottomless pit."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 7: <i>Have but a ferret</i>)&mdash;Ver. 185. This passage has
      much puzzled the Commentators; but allowing for some very far-fetched wit,
      which is not uncommon with Plautus, it may admit of some explanation. He
      tells the Parasite that he had better look for a nicer dinner, a hare, in
      fact; for that in dining with him, he will only get the ferret (with which
      the hare was hunted) for his dinner. Then, inasmuch as the ferret was and
      for following the bare or rabbit into "scruposae viae," "impervious" or
      "rocky places" where they had burrowed, he adds: "For my dinner,
      ferret-like, frequents ragged places;" by which he probably means that it
      is nothing but a meagre repast of vegetables, of which possibly capers
      formed a part, which grow plentifully in Italy, in old ruins and craggy
      spots. Some suggest that it was a custom with the huntsmen, if they failed
      to catch the hurt, to kill and eat the ferret.}

      "asper" means either "unsavoury" or "prickly," according to the context.
      Hegio means to use it in the former sense, but the Parasite, for the sake
      of repartee, chooses to take it in the latter.}

      ACT II.&mdash;SCENE I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Enter, from the house,</i> PHILOCRATES, TYNDARUS, <i>and</i> SLAVES <i>and</i>
      CAPTIVES of HEGIO.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. If the immortal Gods have so willed it that you should undergo this
      affliction, it becomes you to endure it with equanimity; if you do so,
      your trouble will be lighter {1}. At home you were free men, I suppose;
      now if slavery has befallen you, 'tis a becoming way for you to put up
      with it, and by your dispositions to render it light, under a master's
      rule. Unworthy actions which a master does must be deemed Worthy ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. <i>and</i> TYND. Alas! alas! alas! SLAVE. There's no need for
      wailing; you cause much injury to your eyes. In adversity, if you use
      fortitude of mind, it is of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. <i>and</i> TYND. But we are ashamed, because we are in bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. But in the result it might cause vexation to our master, if he were
      to release you from chains, or allow you to be loose, whom he has
      purchased with his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. <i>and</i> TYND. What does he fear from us? We know our duty, what
      it is, if he allows us to be loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. Why, you are meditating escape. I know what it is you are devising.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. <i>and</i> TYND. We, make our escape? Whither should we escape?
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. To your own country. PHIL. <i>and</i> TYND. Out upon you; it would
      ill befit us to be following the example of runaways.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. Why, faith, should there be an opportunity, I don't advise you not.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. <i>and</i> TYND. Do you allow us to make one request.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. What is it, pray? PHIL. <i>and</i> TYND. That you will give us an
      opportunity of conversing, without these and yourselves for overlookers.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. Be it so; go you away from here, <i>you people</i>. Let's step
      here, on one side. (<i>To the other</i> CAPTIVES <i>and</i> SLAVES.) But
      commence upon a short conversation <i>only</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. O yes, it was my intention so to do. Step aside this way (<i>to</i>
      TYNDARUS).
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE (<i>to the other</i> CAPTIVES). Stand apart from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>to the</i> SLAVE). "We are Both greatly obliged to you, by
      reason of your doing so, since you allow us to obtain what we are desirous
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Step here then, at a distance now, if you think fit, that no
      listeners may be enabled to overhear our discourse, and that this plan of
      ours mayn't be divulged before them for a stratagem is no stratagem, if
      you don't plan it with art but <i>it is</i> a very great misfortune if it
      becomes disclosed. For if you are my master, and I represent myself as
      your servant, still there's need of foresight, <i>and</i> need of caution,
      that this may be carried out discreetly and without overlookers, with
      carefulness and with cautious prudence and diligence. So great is the
      matter that has been commenced upon; this must not be carried out in any
      drowsy fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Just as you shall desire me to be, I will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I trust <i>so</i>. TYND. For now you see that for your precious life
      I'm setting at stake my own, <i>as</i> dear <i>to me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I know it. TYND. But remember to know it when you shall be enjoying
      that which you wish for; for mostly, the greatest part of mankind follow
      this fashion; what they wish for, until they obtain it, they are
      rightminded; but when they have now got it in their power, from being
      rightminded they become most deceitful, and most dishonest; now I do
      consider that you are towards me as I wish. What I advise you, I would
      advise my own father.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I' faith, if I could venture, I would call you father; for next to
      my own father, you are my nearest father.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I understand. PHIL. And therefore I remind you the more frequently,
      that you may remember it. I am not your master, but your servant; now this
      one thing I do beseech you. Inasmuch as the immortal Gods hare disclosed
      to us their wishes, that they desire me to have <i>once</i> been your
      master, and now to be your fellow-captive; what formerly of my right I
      used to command you, now with entreaties do I beg of you, by our uncertain
      fortunes, and by the kindness of my father towards you, <i>and</i> by our
      common captivity, which has befallen us by the hand of the enemy, don't
      you pay me any greater respect than <i>I did you</i> when you were my
      slave; and don't you forget to remember who you were, and who you now are.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I know, indeed, that I now am you, and that you are I.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Well, if you are able carefully to remember that, I have <i>some</i>
      hope in this scheme <i>of ours</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Will be lighter</i>)&mdash;Ver. 197. The English proverb
      corresponds with this: What can't be cured must be endured.}

    <h2>
      SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Enter</i> HEGIO, <i>from his house, speaking to those
      within.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      HEG. I shall return in-doors just now, when I shall have discovered from
      these people what I want <i>to know</i>. (<i>To the</i> SLAVES.) Where are
      those persons whom I ordered to be brought out of doors here, before the
      house?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. By my faith, I find that you have taken due precaution that we
      shouldn't be missed by you, so walled in are we with chains and keepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. He that takes precaution that he mayn't be deceived, is hardly on his
      guard, even while he's taking precaution; even when he has supposed that
      he has taken every precaution, full often is this wary man outwitted. Was
      there not good reason, indeed, for me to watch you carefully, whom I
      purchased with so large a sum of ready money?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Troth, it isn't fair for us to hold you to blame, because you watch
      us <i>closely</i>; nor yet for you us, if we go away hence, should there
      be an opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. As you <i>are</i> here, so is my son a captive there among your
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. He, a captive?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Even so.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. We, then, have not proved the only cowards {1}.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (to PHILOCRATES, <i>supposing him to be the SERVANT of the other</i>).
      Step you aside this way, for there are some things that I wish to enquire
      of you in private, on which subjects I would have you not to be untruthful
      to me. (<i>They step aside.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I will not be, as to that which I shall know; if I shall not know
      anything, that which I don't know I'll tell you of.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>aside</i>). Now is the old fellow in the barber's shop; now, at
      this very instant, is <i>Philocrates</i> wielding the razor {2}. He hasn't
      cared, indeed, to put on the barber's cloth {3}, so as not to soil his
      dress. But whether to say that he's going to share him close, or <i>trim
      him</i> {4} through the comb {5}, I don't know; but if he's wise, he'll
      scrape him right well to the very quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to</i> PHILOCRATES). Which would you? Would you prefer to be a
      slave, or a free man?&mdash;Tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. That which is the nearest to good, and the furthest off from evil,
      do I prefer; although my servitude hasn't proved very grievous <i>to me</i>,
      nor has it been otherwise to me than if I had been a son in the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>aside</i>). Capital! I wouldn't purchase, at a talent's price <i>even</i>,
      Thales the Milesian {6}; for compared with this man's wisdom, he was a
      very twaddler. How cleverly has he suited his language to the slave's
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Of what family is this Philocrates born?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. The Polyplusian {7}; which one family is flourishing there, and held
      in highest esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. What is he himself? In what esteem is he held there?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. In the highest, and <i>that</i> by the very highest men.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Since, then, he is held in such great respect among the Eleans, as
      you tell of, what substance has he?&mdash;Of large amount?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. <i>Enough for him, even</i>, when an old man, to be melting out the
      tallow {8}
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. What is his father? Is he living? PHIL, When we departed thence, we
      left him alive; whether he's living now or not, Orcus, forsooth, must know
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>aside</i>). The matter's all right; he's not only lying, <i>but</i>
      he's even philosophizing now.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. What's his name? PHIL. Thesaurochrysonicocroesides {9}.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. That name has been given, I suppose, by reason of his wealth, as it
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Troth, not so, <i>but</i> rather by reason of his avarice and
      grasping disposition; for, indeed, he was Theodoromedes originally by
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. How say you? Is his father covetous?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Aye, by my faith, he is covetous. Why, that you may even understand
      it the better,&mdash;when he's sacrificing at any time to his own Genius
      {10}, the vessels that are needed for the sacrifice he uses of Samian
      ware, lest the Genius himself should steal them; from this, consider how
      much he would trust other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>addressing</i> TYNDARUS <i>as though</i> PHILOCRATES). Do you
      then follow me this way. (<i>Aside.</i>) The things that I desire <i>to
      know</i>, I'll enquire of him. (<i>Addressing</i> TYNDARUS.) Philocrates,
      this person has done as it becomes an honest man to do. For from him I've
      learnt of what family you are sprang; he has confessed it to me. If you
      are willing to own these same things (which, however, understand that I <i>already</i>
      know from him), you will be doing it for your own advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. He did his duty when he confessed the truth to you, although, Hegio,
      I wished carefully to conceal both my rank and my wealth; now, inasmuch as
      I've lost my country and my liberty, I don't think it right for him to be
      dreading me rather than you. The might of warfare has made my fortunes on
      a level with himself. I remember <i>the time</i> when he didn't dare <i>to
      do it</i> in word; now, in deed, he is at liberty to offend me. But don't
      you see? Human fortune moulds and fashions just, as she wills. Myself, who
      was a free man she has made a slave, from the very highest the very
      lowest. I, who was accustomed to command, now obey the mandates of
      another. And indeed, if I meet with a master just such as I proved the
      ruler in my own household, I shall not fear that he will rule me harshly
      or severely. With this, Hegio, I wished you to be acquainted, unless
      perchance you yourself wish it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Speak boldly <i>out</i>. TYND. As free a man was I till lately as
      your son. As much did a hostile hand deprive me of my liberty as him of
      his. As much is he a slave among my people, as am now a slave here with
      yourself. There is undoubtedly a God, who both hears and sees the things
      which we do. Just as you shall treat me here, in the same degree will he
      have a care for him. To the well-deserving will he show favour, to the
      ill-deserving will he give a like return. As much as you lament your son,
      so much does my father lament me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. That I am aware of. But do you admit the same that he has disclosed
      to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I confess that my father has very great wealth at home, and that I
      am born of a very noble family; but I entreat you, Hegio, let not my
      riches make your mind too prone to avarice, lest it should seem to my
      father, although I am his only <i>son</i>, more suitable that I should be
      a slave in your house, bountifully supplied at your expense and with your
      clothing, rather than be living the life of a beggar where 'twould be far
      from honorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. By the favour of the Gods and of my forefathers, I am rich enough. I
      don't quite believe that every <i>kind of</i> gain is serviceable to
      mankind. I know that gain has already made many a man famous; and yet
      there are occasions when it is undoubtedly better to incur loss than <i>to
      make</i> gain. Gold I detest: many a one has it persuaded to many an evil
      course. Now give your attention to this, that you may know as well what my
      wishes are. My son, taken prisoner, is in servitude at Elis there among
      your people; if you restore him to me, don't you give me a single coin
      besides; both you and him, <i>your servant</i>, I'll send back from here;
      on no other terms can you depart <i>hence</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. You ask what's very right and very just, and you are the very
      kindest person of all mankind. But whether is he in servitude to a private
      person or to the public {11}?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. In private <i>servitude</i> to Menarchus, a physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. By my faith, that person's surely his father's dependant. Why
      really, that's down as pat for you, as the shower is when it rains.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Do you <i>then</i> cause this person, <i>my son</i>, to be redeemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I'll do <i>so</i>: but this I beg of you, Hegio&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Whatever you wish, so that you request nothing against my interest,
      I'll do.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Listen then, <i>and</i> you'll know. I don't ask for myself to be
      released, until he has returned. But I beg of you to give me him (<i>pointing
      to</i> PHILOCRATES) with a price set {12} upon him, that I may send him to
      my father, that this person, <i>your son</i>, may be redeemed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Why no; I'd rather send another person hence, when there shall be a
      truce, to confer with your father there, <i>and</i> to carry your
      injunctions which you shall entrust him with, just as you wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. But it's of no use to send to him one that he doesn't know; you'd be
      losing your labour. Send this person; he'll have it all completed, if he
      gets there. And you cannot send any person to him more faithful, nor one
      in whom he places more confidence, nor who is more a servant after his own
      mind; nor, in fact, one to whom he would more readily entrust your son.
      Have no fears; at my own peril I'll make proof of his fidelity, relying
      upon his disposition; because he is sensible that I'm kindly disposed
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Well then, I'll send him with a price set upon him, on the surety of
      your promise, if you wish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I do wish it; so soon as ever it can, I want this matter to be
      brought to completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. What reason is there, then, that if he doesn't return, you should not
      pay me twenty minae for him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Yes&mdash;very good. HEG. (<i>to the</i> SLAVES, <i>who obey</i>).
      Release him now forthwith; and, indeed, both of them. (<i>On being
      released</i>, PHILOCRATES <i>goes into the house</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. May all the Gods grant you all your desires, since you have deigned
      me honor so great, and since you release me from my chains. Really, this
      is not <i>so</i> irksome now, since my neck is free from the collar-chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. The kindnesses that are done to the good, thanks for the same are
      pregnant with blessings. Now, if you are about to send him thither,
      direct, instruct him, give him the orders which you wish to be carried to
      your father. Should you like me to call him to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Do call him. (HEGIO <i>goes to the door, and calls</i> PHILOCRATES.)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>The only cowards</i>)&mdash;Ver. 267. He alludes to the
      notion in the heroic times, that it was the duty of a warrior to conquer
      or to die, and that it was disgraceful to be made prisoner.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Wielding the razor</i>)&mdash;Ver. 271. It is hard to say
      whether by the word "cuttros," in this passage, razors or scissors are
      meant.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>To put on the barber's cloth</i>)&mdash;Ver. 272. He
      probably means by this expression that Philocrates has made no preamble,
      and shown no hesitation, in commencing at once to dupe the old man.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>Or trim him</i>)&mdash;Ver. 273. He alludes here to the
      two kinds of shaving and trimming the beard used by the barbers among the
      ancients. The one was close "strictim," when they shaved to the skin; the
      other was, when with a pair of scissors they clipped the hair, with the
      interposition of a comb. The former fashion was called by the Greeks
      {Greek: <i>skaphion</i>}; the latter method, which was borrowed from the
      Persians, {Greek: <i>kaepos</i>}. "Esse in tonstrina," "to be in the
      barber's shop," was a proverbial expression to denote "being imposed
      upon." Tyndarus is wondering to what extent Philocrates is going to impose
      upon Hegio.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>Through the comb</i>)&mdash;Ver. 273. The Greeks and
      Romans made their combs of boxwood, much of which was imported from
      Paphlagonia. The Egyptians used them made of wood and of ivory, and
      toothed on one side only; while those of the Greeks had teeth on both
      sides.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>Thales the Milesian</i>)&mdash;Ver. 279. A talent would be
      a low price for such a learned slave as Thales the Milesian, who was one
      of the seven wise men of Greece. He says, however, that Thales at such a
      low price would be nothing in comparison with Philocrates for the same
      money.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 7: <i>The Polyplusian</i>)&mdash;Ver. 282. This word is coined
      by Philocrates for the occasion, as being the name of his family, from the
      Greek word <i>{Greek: polyplousios}</i>, "very wealthy;" probably with the
      idea of raising the expectations of Hegio and making him the more ready to
      promote an exchange of his own son for a member of so opulent a family.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 8: <i>Melting out the tallow</i>)&mdash;Ver. 286. Hegio asks him
      if his riches are very abundant, and in doing so uses the word "opimae,"
      of which the primary meaning was "fat;" the other answers, "Yes, so fat
      that he can be melting the tallow out of them even when he is an old man;"
      meaning thereby that he is amply provided with means.}.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 9: <i>Thesaurochrysonicocraesides</i>)&mdash;Ver. 290. This is a
      name made up of several Greek words, and seems to mean "a son of Croesus,
      abounding in treasures of gold," in allusion to Croesus, the wealthy king
      of Lydia. The author indulges in similar pleasantry in the Miles
      Gloriosus.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 10: <i>To his own Genius</i>)&mdash;Ver. 295. As the Genius of a
      man was not only his guardian Deity through life, but the word was also
      used to signify his capacity for enjoyment; the term "to sacrifice to his
      Genius," is supposed by some Commentators to mean, "to indulge the
      appetite in feasting and good cheer." This, however, seems not to be the
      meaning in this instance; and he probably intends to be understood as
      alluding, literally, to the domestic sacrifice to the Genius.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 11: <i>Or to the public</i>)&mdash;Ver. 339. Some captives were
      employed in the public service, while others fell into the hands of
      private individuals.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 12: <i>With a price set</i>)&mdash;Ver. 845. "Aestimatus" here
      means "entrusted to a person at a fixed value, and at his risk for the due
      return of it."}

    <h2>
      SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Enter</i> PHILOCRATES, <i>from the house.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      HEG. May this affair turn out happily for myself and for my son, and for
      yourselves. (<i>To</i> PHILOCRATES.) Your new master wishes you to pay
      faithful obedience to your former owner in what he wishes. For I have
      presented you to him, with the price of twenty minae set upon you: and he
      says that he is desirous to send you away hence to his father, that he may
      there redeem my son, <i>and</i> that an exchange may be made between me
      and him for our <i>respective</i> sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. My disposition takes its course straight in either direction, both
      to yourself and to him; as a wheel {1} you may make use of me; either this
      way or that can I be turned, whichever way you shall command me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. You yourself profit the most from your own disposition, when you
      endure slavery just as it ought to be endured. Follow me. (<i>To</i>
      TYNDARUS.) See here's <i>your</i> man.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I return you thanks, since you give me this opportunity and
      permission to send this messenger to my parents, who may relate all the
      matter in its order to my father, what I'm doing here, and what I wish to
      be done. (<i>To</i> PHILOCRATES.) Now, Tyndarus, thus is it arranged
      between myself and him, that I'm to send you, valued at a fixed price, to
      my father in Elis; so that, if you don't return hither, I'm to give twenty
      minae for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I think that you've come to a right understanding. For your father
      expects either myself or some messenger to come from here to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I wish you, then, to mind what message it is I want you to carry
      hence to my country to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Philocrates, as up to this moment I have done, I will take all due
      care to endeavour that which may especially conduce to your interest, and
      to pursue the same with heart and soul, and with my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. You act just as you ought to act; now I wish you to give attention.
      In the first place of all, carry my respects to my mother and my father,
      and to my relations, and if any one else you see well-disposed <i>towards
      me</i>: <i>say</i> that I am in health here, and that I am a slave, in
      servitude to this most worthy man, who has ever honored me more and more
      with his respect, and does <i>so still</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Don't you be instructing me as to that; I can, still, easily bear
      that in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. For, indeed, except that I have a keeper, I deem myself to be a free
      man. Tell my father on what terms I have agreed with this party about his
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. What I remember, it is sheer delay to be putting me in mind of.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. To redeem me, and to send him back here in exchange for both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I'll remember it. HEG. But as soon as he can that is especially to
      the interest of us both.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. You <i>are</i> not more <i>anxious</i> to see your son, than he <i>is
      to see</i> his.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. My son is dear to myself, <i>and</i> his own to every man.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. (<i>to</i> TYNDARUS). Do you wish any other message to be carried to
      your father?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. <i>Say</i> that I am well here; and do you boldly tell him,
      Tyndarus, that we have been of dispositions for uninterrupted harmony
      between ourselves, and that you have neither been deserving of censure,
      nor that I have proved your enemy; and that still, amid miseries so great,
      you have shown implicit obedience to your master, and that you have never
      abandoned me, either in deed or in fidelity, amid my wavering,
      unprosperous fortunes. When my father shall know this, Tyndarus, how
      well-disposed you have proved towards his son and himself, he will never
      be so avaricious but that he'll give you your liberty for nothing. And by
      my own endeavours, if I return hence, I'll make him do so the more
      readily. For by your aid and kindness, and good disposition and prudence,
      you have caused me to be allowed to return to my parents once again,
      inasmuch as to <i>Hegio</i> you have confessed both my rank and my wealth;
      by means of which, through your wisdom, you have liberated your master
      from his chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. The things which you mention I have done, and I am pleased that you
      remember this. Deservedly have they been done for you by me; for now,
      Philocrates, if I, too, were to mention the things that you have kindly
      done for me, the night would cut short the day. For, had you been my slave
      <i>even</i>, no otherwise were you always obliging to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Ye Gods, by our trust in you! <i>behold</i> the kindly disposition of
      <i>these</i> persons! How they draw <i>the very</i> tears from me! See how
      cordially they love each other, <i>and</i> with what praises the servant
      has commended his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I' troth, he hasn't commended me the one hundredth part of what he
      himself deserves to be commended in my praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to</i> PHILOCRATES). Since, then, you have acted most becomingly,
      now there's an opportunity to add to your good in managing this matter
      with fidelity towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I am not able more to wish it done, than by my endeavours to try to
      bring it about. That you may know this, Hegio, with praises do I call
      supreme Jove to witness that I will not prove unfaithful to Philocrates
      {2}&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. You are a worthy fellow. PHIL. And that I will never in anything act
      otherwise towards him than towards my own self.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I wish you to put these speeches to the test, both by your deeds and
      your actions; and inasmuch as I have said the less about you than I had
      wished, I wish you <i>the more</i> to give me your attention, and take you
      care not to be angry with me by reason of these words. But, I beseech you,
      reflect that you are sent hence home with a price set upon you at my risk,
      and that my life is here left as a pledge for you. Do not you forget me
      the very moment that you have left my presence, since you will have left
      me here behind a captive in captivity for yourself, and <i>don't</i>
      consider yourself as free, <i>and</i> forsake your pledge {3}, and not use
      your endeavours for you to bring his son home again, in return for me.
      Understand that you are sent hence valued at twenty minae. Take care to
      prove scrupulously faithful; take care that you show not a wavering
      fidelity. For my father, I am sure, will do everything that he ought to
      do. Preserve me as a constant friend to you, and find out {4} this person
      <i>so lately</i> discovered. These things, by your right hand, holding you
      with my <i>own</i> right hand, do I beg of you; do not prove less true to
      me than I have proved to you. This matter do you attend to; you are now my
      master, you my patron, you my father; to you do I commend my hopes and my
      fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. You have given injunctions enough. Are you satisfied if I bring back
      accomplished what you have enjoined?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Satisfied. PHIL. (<i>to</i> HEGIO). According to your wishes, and (<i>to</i>
      TYNDARUS) according to yours, will I return, hither provided. Is there
      anything else?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. For you to return bad as soon as ever you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. The business <i>itself</i> reminds <i>me of that</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to</i> PHILOCRATES). Follow me, that I may give you your expenses
      for the journey at my banker's; on the same occasion I'll get a passport
      from the Praetor.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. What passport {5}? HEG. For him to take with him hence to the army,
      that he may be allowed to go home from here. (<i>To</i> TYNDARUS.) You go
      in-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Speed you well. PHIL. Right heartily, farewell. (TYNDARUS <i>goes
      into the house.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>aside</i>). I' faith, I compassed my design, when I purchased
      these men of the Quaestors out of the spoil. I have released my son from
      slavery, if <i>so</i> it pleases the Gods; and yet I hesitated a long time
      whether I should purchase or should not purchase these persons. Watch that
      man indoors, if you please, you servants, that he may nowhere move a foot
      without a guard. I shall soon make my appearance at home; now I'm going to
      my brother's, to see my other captives; at the same time I'll enquire
      whether any one knows this young man. (<i>To</i> PHILOCRATES.) Do you
      follow, that I may despatch you. I wish attention first to be paid to that
      matter. (<i>Exeunt.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>As a wheel</i>)&mdash;Ver. 374. This may either mean the
      wheel of a vehicle or a potter's wheel. The wheels used by the ancients
      revolved on the axle, as in the carriages of modern times, and were
      prevented, by pins inserted, from falling off. They consisted of naves,
      spokes, which varied much in number, the felly, or wooden circumference,
      made of elastic wood, such as the poplar and wild fig, and composed of
      several segments united, and the tire, which was of metal. Some of their
      carts and waggons had wheels made of a solid circle of wood, in shape like
      a millstone, with the axle running through the middle. Similar wheels are
      used in the south of Europe at the present day.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Unfaithful to Philocrates</i>)&mdash;Ver. 432. Philocrates
      might very safely take an oath to Hegio, that he would not prove
      unfaithful to himself.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>Forsake your pledge</i>)&mdash;Ver. 441. Alluding to
      himself being left behind, and a surety for his speedy return.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>And find out</i>)&mdash;Ver. 446. "Atque hunc inventum
      inveni." Some would render this, "And find this person still as you have
      found him," making it allude to Hegio; it seems, however, rather to apply
      to the son of Hegio, and to mean, "Do you seek out this person whom we
      have found out to be in the possession of the physician, Menarchus."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>What passport?</i>)&mdash;Ver. 454. Being conscious of the
      trick which they are playing on the worthy old man, Tyndarus shows some
      alarm on hearing a passport, or "syngraphus," mentioned. Commentators are
      at a loss to know why he should express such alarm. It is difficult to
      say, but, probably, as there was in the passport a description of the
      bearer, who would be Philocrates under the name of Tyndarus, it suddenly
      comes to the recollection of Tyndarus that they were originally made
      prisoners under their proper names, and that possibly Philocrates may be
      recognised as attempting to pass under an assumed name.}

      ACT III.&mdash;SCENE I.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <i>Enter</i> ERGASILUS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      ERG. Wretched is that man who is in search of something to eat, and finds
      that with difficulty; but more wretched is he who both seeks with
      difficulty, and finds nothing at all; most wretched is he, who, when he
      desires to eat, has not that which he may eat. But, by my faith, if I <i>only</i>
      could, I'd willingly tear out the eyes of this day;&mdash;with such enmity
      has it filled all people towards me. One more starved out I never did see,
      nor one more filled with hunger {1}, nor one who prospers less in whatever
      he begins to do. So much do my stomach and my throat take rest on these
      fasting holidays {2}. Away with the profession of a Parasite to very utter
      and extreme perdition! so much in these days do the young men drive away
      from them the needy drolls. They care nothing now-a-days for <i>these</i>
      Laconian men {3} of the lowest benches&mdash;these whipping-posts, who
      hare their <i>clever</i> sayings without provision and <i>without</i>
      money. They <i>now-a-days</i> seek those who, when they've eaten at their
      pleasure, may give them a return at their own houses. They go themselves
      to market, which formerly was the province of the Parasites. They go
      themselves from the Forum to the procurers with face as exposed{4} as <i>the
      magistrates</i> in court {5}, with face exposed, condemn those who are
      found guilty; nor do they now value buffoons at one farthing {6}; all are
      <i>so much</i> in love with themselves. For, when, just now, I went away
      from here, I came to some young men in the Forum: "Good morrow," said I;
      "whither are we going together to breakfast?" On this, they were silent.
      "Who says, 'here, <i>at my house</i>,' or who makes an offer?" said I.
      Just like dumb men, they were silent, and didn't smile at me. "Where do we
      dine?" said I. On this they declined, said one funny saying out of my best
      bon mots, by which I formerly used to get feasting for a month; not an
      individual smiled; at once I knew that the matter was arranged by concert.
      Not even one was willing to imitate a dog when provoked; if they didn't
      laugh, they might, at least, have grinned with their teeth {7}. From them
      I went away, after I saw that I was thus made sport of. I went to some
      others; <i>then</i> to some others I came; then to some others&mdash;the
      same the result. All treat the matter in confederacy, just like the
      oil-merchants in the Velabrum {8}. Now, I've returned thence, since I see
      myself made sport of there. In like manner do other Parasites walk to and
      fro, to no purpose, in the Forum. Now, after the foreign fashion {9}, I'm
      determined to enforce all my rights. Those who have entered into a
      confederacy, by which to deprive us of food and life,&mdash;for them I'll
      name a day. I'll demand, as the damages, that they shall give me ten
      dinners at my own option, when provisions are dear: thus will I do. Now
      I'll go hence to the harbour. There, is my only hope of a dinner; if that
      shall fail me, I'll return here to the old gentleman, to his unsavoury
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Filled with hunger</i>)&mdash;Ver. 471. This paradoxical
      expression is similar to the one used in the Aulularia, 1. 45, "inaniis
      oppletae," "filled with emptiness."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Fasting holidays</i>)&mdash;Ver. 473. He means to say,
      that as on feast days and holidays people abstain from work, so at present
      his teeth and stomach have no employment.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>These Laconian men</i>)&mdash;Ver. 476. The Parasites,
      when there was not room for them on the "triclinia," or "couches" at
      table, were forced to sit on "subsellia," or "benches," at the bottom of
      the table. This was like the custom of the Spartans, or Laconians, who,
      eschewing the luxury of reclining, always persisted in sitting at meals.
      The Spartans, also, endured pain with the greatest firmness; a virtue much
      required by Parasites, in order to put up with the indignities which they
      had to endure from the guests, who daubed their faces, broke pots about
      their heads, and boxed their ears.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>With face as exposed</i>)&mdash;Ver. 480. People, with any
      sense of decency, would resort to these places either in masks, or with a
      hood thrown over the face.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>In court</i>)&mdash;Ver. 481. "In tribu." He alludes to
      the trials which took place before the Roman people in the "Comitia
      Tributa," or "assemblies of the tribes," where the Tribunes and Aediles
      acted as the accusers. The offences for which persons were summoned before
      the tribes, were, bad conduct of a magistrate in performance of his
      duties, neglect of duty, mismanagement of a war, embezzlement of the
      public money, breaches of the peace, usury, adultery, and some other
      crimes. The "Comitia Tributa" were used as courts of appeal, when a person
      protested against a fine imposed by a magistrate.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>At one farthing</i>)&mdash;Ver. 482. Literally, "at a
      teruncius," which was a small coin among the Romans, containing three
      "unciae," "twelfth parts" or one quarter of the "as," which we generally
      take as equivalent to a penny.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 7: <i>Grinned with their teeth</i>)&mdash;Ver. 491. That is, by
      showing their teeth and grinning. This is not unlike the expression used
      in the Psalms (according to the translation in our Liturgy)&mdash;Ps.
      lix., ver. 6&mdash;"They grin like a dog and run about through the city."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 8: <i>In the Velabrum</i>)&mdash;Ver. 494. The "Via Nova," or
      "New Street," at Rome, led from the interior of the city to the "Velabra."
      The greater and the less "Velabrum" lay between the Palatine and the
      Capitoline Hills, where fruits and other commodities were sold in booths,
      or under awnings, from which ("vela") the streets probably derived their
      name. Varro, however, says that they were so called from the verb "veho,"
      "to carry;" because in early times those spots were traversed in boats,
      which mode of carriage was called "velatura." From the present passage, it
      appears that the oil-merchants in the "Velabra" acted in confederacy not
      to sell their oils under a certain price.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 9: <i>After the foreign fashion</i>)&mdash;Ver. 497. Some
      suppose that "barbarica lege" here means "the foreign" or "Roman law," and
      that he refers to the "Lex Vinnia," introduced at Rome by Quintus Vinnius,
      which was said to have been passed against those persons who confederated
      for the purpose of keeping up the high prices of provisions. It is,
      however, somewhat doubtful if there really was such a law; and the better
      opinion seems to be that the word "lege" meant "fashion" or "custom;" and
      that he refers to the Roman method of trial. He will accuse his former
      entertainers of a conspiracy to starve him. He will name a day for trial,
      "diem dicet;" he will demand damages or a penalty, "irrogabit muletam;"
      and thus will he proceed at law against them, "sic egerit." Rost has
      written at great length on the meaning of this passage.}

      SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Enter</i> HEGIO <i>and</i> ARISTOPHONTES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to himself</i>). What is there more delightful than to manage
      one's own interests well for the public good {1}, just as I did yesterday,
      when I purchased these men. Every person, as they see me, comes to meet
      me, and congratulates me on this matter. By thus stopping and detaining
      unlucky me, they've made me <i>quite</i> tired. With much ado have I
      survived {2} from being congratulated, to my misfortune. At last, to the
      Praetor did I get. There, scarcely did I rest myself. I asked for a
      passport; it was given me: at once I delivered it to Tyndarus. He started
      for home. Thence, straightway, after that was done, I passed by my house;
      <i>and</i> I went at once to my brother's, where my other captives are. I
      asked about Philocrates from Elis, whether any one of them all knew the
      person. This man (<i>pointing to</i> ARISTOPHONTES) called out that he had
      been his intimate friend; I told him that he was at my house. At once he
      besought and entreated me that I would permit him to see him. Forthwith I
      ordered him to be released <i>from chains</i>. Thence have I come. (<i>To</i>
      ARISTOPHONTES.) Now, do you follow me, that you may obtain what you have
      besought of me, the opportunity of meeting with this person. (<i>They go
      into the house</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>For the public good</i>)&mdash;Ver. 504. It is possible
      that he may here refer to his purchase of Philocrates, whose high position
      among the Eleans would probably tend, on his return to his native country,
      to promote peace between it and the people of Aetoiia.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>With much ado have I survived</i>)&mdash;Ver. 513. "Vox&mdash;eminebam."
      Literally, "I hardly kept myself above" water. He means that he was almost
      overpowered by the crowds of people congratulating him.}

      SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Enter</i> TYNDARUS, <i>from the house</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      TYND. Now stands the matter so, that I would much rather that I had once
      existed, than that I <i>still</i> exist; now do my hopes, my resources,
      and my succour, desert me and spurn themselves. This is that day, when,
      for my life, no safety can be hoped; nor <i>yet</i> is death my end; nor
      hope is there, in fact, to dispel this fear for me; nor cloak have I
      anywhere for my deceitful stratagems; nor for my devices or my subterfuges
      is there anywhere a screen presented to me. No deprecating <i>is there</i>
      for my perfidy; no means of flight for my offences. No refuge is there
      anywhere for my trusting; and no escape for my cunning schemes. What was
      concealed is <i>now</i> exposed; my plans are <i>now</i> divulged. The
      whole matter is now laid open; nor is there any ado about this matter, but
      that I must perish outright, and meet with destruction, both on behalf of
      my master and myself. This Aristophontes has proved my ruin, who has just
      now come into the house. He knows me. He is the intimate friend and
      kinsman of Philocrates. Not Salvation <i>herself</i> {1} can save me now,
      <i>even</i> if she wishes; nor have I any means <i>of escape</i>, unless,
      perchance, I devise some artifice in my mind. (<i>He meditates.</i>)
      Plague on it!&mdash;how? What can I contrive?&mdash;what can I think of?
      Some very great folly and trifling I shall have to begin with. I'm quite
      at a loss. (<i>He retires aside.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Not Salvation herself</i>)&mdash;Ver. 535. This was a
      proverbial expression among the Romans. "Salus," "Safety" or "Salvation,"
      was worshipped as a Goddess at Rome. It is well observed, in Thornton's
      translation, that the word "Salus" may, without irreverence, be translated
      "Salvation," on no less authority than that of Archbishop Tillotson. "If,"
      says he, "men will continue in their sins, the redemption brought by
      Christ will be of no advantage to them; such as obstinately persist in an
      impenitent course," "ipsa si velit Salus, servare non potest." "Salvation
      itself cannot save them."}

    <h2>
      SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>Enter</i> HEGIO, ARISTOPHONTES, <i>and</i> SLAVES, <i>from
      the house.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      HEG. Whither am I to say, now, that that man has betaken himself from the
      house out of doors?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>apart</i>). Now, for a very certainty, I'm done for; the enemies
      are coming to you, Tyndarus! What shall I say?&mdash;what shall I talk of?
      What shall I deny, or what confess? All matters are reduced to
      uncertainty. How shall I place confidence in my resources? I wish the Gods
      had destroyed you, before you were lost to your own country,
      Aristophontes, who, from a plot well concerted, are making it
      disconcerted. This plan is ruined, outright, unless I find out for myself
      some extremely bold device.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to</i> ARISTOPHONTES). Follow me. See, there is the man; go to
      him and address him.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>aside, and turning away</i>). What mortal among mortals is there
      more wretched than myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. (<i>coming up to him</i>). Why's this, that I'm to say that you are
      avoiding my gaze, Tyndarus? And <i>why</i> that you are slighting me as a
      stranger, as though you had never known me? Why, I'm as much a slave as
      yourself; although at home I was a free man, you, even from your
      childhood, have always served in slavery in Elia.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I' faith, I'm very little surprised, if either he does avoid your
      gaze, or if he does shun you, who are calling him Tyndarus, instead of
      Philocrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Hegio, this person was accounted a madman in Elis. Don't you give
      ear to what he prates about; for at home he has pursued his father and
      mother with spears, and that malady sometimes comes upon him which is spit
      out {1}. Do you this instant stand away at a distance from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to</i> the SLAVES). Away with him further off from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Do you say, you whipp'd knave, that I am mad, and do you declare
      that I have followed my own father with spears? And that I have that
      malady, that it's necessary for me to be spit upon {2}?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Don't be dismayed; that malady afflicts many a person to whom it has
      proved wholesome to be spit upon, and has been of service to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Why, what do you say? Do you, too, credit him?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Credit him in what? ARIST. That I am mad?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Do you see him, with what a furious aspect he's looking at you?
      'Twere best to retire, Hegio; it is as I said, his frenzy grows apace;
      have a care for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I thought that he was mad, the moment that he called you Tyndarus.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Why, he's sometimes ignorant of his own name and doesn't know what
      it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. But he even said that you were his intimate friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. So far from that, I never saw him. Why, really, Alcmaeon, and
      Orestes, and Lycurgus {3} besides, are my friends on the same principle
      that he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Villain, and do you dare speak ill of me, as well? Do I not know
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I' faith, it really is very clear that you don't know him, who are
      calling him Tyndarus, instead of Philocrates Him whom you see, you don't
      know; you are addressing him as the person whom you don't see.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. On the contrary this fellow's saying that he is the person who he
      is not; and he says that he is not the person who he really is.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. You've been found, of course, to excel Philocrates in truthfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. By my troth, as I understand the matter, you've been found to
      brazen out the truth by lying. But i' faith, prithee, come then, look at
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>looking at him</i>). Well! ARIST. Say, now; do you deny that you
      are Tyndarus?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I do deny it, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Do you say that you are Philocrates?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I do say so, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. (<i>to</i> HEGIO). And do you believe him?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. More, indeed, than either you or myself. For he, in fact, who you say
      that he is (<i>pointing to</i> TYNDARUS), has set out hence to-day for
      Elis, to this person's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. What father, when he's a slave. {4}
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. And so are you a slave, and <i>yet</i> you were a free man; and I
      trust that so I shall be, if I restore his son here to liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. How say you, villain? Do you say that you were born a free man
      {liber}?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I really do not say that I am Liber {5}, but that I am Philocrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. How's this? How this scoundrel, Hegio, is making sport of you now.
      For he's a slave himself, and never, except his own self, had he a slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Because you yourself are destitute in your own country, and haven't
      whereon to live at home, you wish all to be found like to yourself; you
      don't do anything surprising. 'Tis <i>the nature</i> of the distressed to
      be ill-disposed, and to envy the fortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Hegio, take you care, please, that you don't persist in rashly
      placing confidence in this man; for so far as I see, he is certainly now
      putting some device in execution, in saying that he is redeeming your son
      <i>from captivity</i>; that is by no means satisfactory to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I know that you don't wish that to be done; still I shall effect it,
      if the Gods assist me. I shall bring him back here, <i>and</i> he <i>will
      restore</i> me to my father, in Elis. For that purpose have I sent
      Tyndarus hence to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Why, you yourself are he; nor is there any slave in Elis of that
      name, except yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Do you persist in reproaching me with being a slave&mdash;a thing
      that has befallen me through the fortune of war?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Really, now, I cannot contain myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>to</i> HEGIO). Ha! don't you hear him? Why don't you take to
      flight? He'll be pelting us just now with stones there, unless you order
      him to be seized.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. I'm distracted. TYND. His eyes strike fire; there's need of a rope,
      Hegio. Don't you see how his body is spotted all over with livid spots?
      Black bile {6} is disordering the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. And, by my faith, if this old gentleman is wise, black pitch {7}
      will be disordering you with the executioner, and giving a light to your
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. He's now talking in his fit of delirium; sprites are in possession
      of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. By my troth, suppose I order him to be seized?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. You would be acting more wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. I'm vexed that I haven't a stone, to knock out the brains of that
      whip-scoundrel, who's driving mo to madness by his taunts.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Don't you hear that he's looking for a stone?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. I wish to speak with you alone, separately, Hegio.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Speak from where you are, if you want anything; though at a distance,
      I shall hear you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. <i>Yes</i>, for, by my faith, if you approach nearer, he'll to
      taking your nose off with his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. By heavens, Hegio, don't you believe that I am mad, or that I ever
      was <i>so</i>, or that I have the malady which that fellow avers. But if
      you fear anything from me, order me to be bound: I wish it, so long as
      that fellow is bound as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Why really, Hegio, rather let him be bound that wishes it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Now hold your tongue! I'll make you, <i>you</i> false Philocrates,
      to be found out this day <i>to be</i> a real Tyndarus. Why are you making
      signs {8} at me?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I, making signs at you? (<i>To</i> HEGIO.) What would he do, if you
      were at a greater distance off?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. What do you say? What if I approach this madman?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Nonsense; you'll be made a fool of; he'll be prating <i>stuff</i>,
      to you, neither the feet nor the head of which will ever be visible. The
      dress <i>only</i> {9} is wanting; in seeing this man, you behold Ajax
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I don't care; still I'll approach him. (<i>Advances to</i>
      ARISTOPHONTES.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>aside</i>). Now am I utterly undone; now between the sacrifice
      and the stone {10} do I stand, nor know I what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I lend you my attention, Aristophontes, if there is anything that you
      would wish with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. From me you shall hear <i>that</i> truth, which now you think to be
      false, Hegio. But I wish, in the first place, to clear myself from this
      with you&mdash;that madness does not possess me, and that I have no
      malady, except that I am in captivity; and, so may the King of Gods and of
      men make me to regain my native land, that fellow there is no more
      Philocrates than either I or you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Come, then, tell me who he is?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. He whom I've told you all along from the beginning. If you shall
      find him any other than that person, I show no cause why I shouldn't
      suffer the loss with you both of my parents and of my liberty <i>for ever</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to</i> TYNDARUS). What say you <i>to this</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. That I am your slave, and you my master.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I didn't ask that&mdash;were you a free man?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I was. ARIST. But he really wasn't; he is deceiving you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. How do you know? Were you, perchance, the midwife of my mother,
      since you dare to affirm this so boldly?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. When a boy, I saw yourself, a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. But, grown up, I <i>now</i> see you grown up; so, there's for you,
      in return. If you did right, you wouldn't be troubling yourself about my
      concerns; do I trouble myself about yours?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Was his father <i>called</i> Thesaurochrysonicocroesides?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. He was not; and I never heard that name before this day.
      Theodoromedes was the father of Philocrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>aside</i>). I'm downright undone. Why don't you be quiet, heart
      of mine? Go and be stretched, and hang yourself; you are throbbing <i>so,
      that</i> unfortunate I can hardly stand up for <i>my</i> fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Is a full assurance given me that this was a slave in Elis, and that
      he is not Philocrates?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. So fully, that you will never find this to be otherwise; but where
      is he {11} now?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Where I the least, and he the most could wish himself. In
      consequence, then, I'm cut asunder, {12} disjointed, to my sorrow, by the
      devices of this scoundrel, who has bamboozled me by his tricks just as he
      has thought fit. But do, please, have a care <i>that you are right</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Why, I assure you of this, <i>as</i> an ascertained and established
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. For certain? ARIST. Why, nothing, I say, will you find more certain
      than this certainty. Philocrates, from when a boy, has ever since that
      time been my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. But of what appearance is your friend Philocrates?
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. I'll tell you: with a thin face, sharp nose, light hair, dark eyes,
      somewhat ruddy, with hair rather crisp and curling.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. <i>The description</i> is like. TYND. (<i>aside</i>). <i>Aye</i>, so
      much so, indeed, that I've this day, much to my sorrow, got into the midst
      of this, i' faith. Woe to those unfortunate rods, which this day will be
      meeting their end upon my back.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I see that I've been imposed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>aside</i>). Why, fetters, do you delay to run towards me and to
      embrace my legs that I may have you in custody?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. And have these <i>two</i> rascally captives really deceived me this
      day with their tricks? the other one pretended that he was the servant and
      this one that he himself was the master. I've lost a kernal; for a
      security, I've left the shell. To such a degree have they imposed upon me,
      {13} both on this side and that, with their trickeries. Still, this fellow
      shall never have the laugh against me. Colaphus, Cordalio, Corax {14} (<i>to
      the</i> SLAVES), go you away and bring out the thongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVE. Are we to be sent to gather faggots {15}? (<i>The</i>SLAVES <i>go
      and bring the thongs from the house</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Which is spit out</i>)&mdash;Ver. 566. Some would render
      the words "qui sputatur," "which is spit upon," and fancy that they find
      authorities in the ancient writers for thinking that epilepsy was treated
      by spitting upon the patient. However, it seems much more probable, that
      the notion was that epilepsy was cured by the patient himself spitting out
      the noxious saliva; and that the word "sputatur" means, "is spit out," <i>i.
      e.</i> "is cured by spitting." Celsus thus describes the "comitialis
      morbus," "epilepsy," or "falling sickness: The person seized, suddenly
      falls down; foam drops from the mouth; then, after a little time, he comes
      to himself, and gets up again without any assistance." Pliny, in his
      Natural History, B. 38, c. 4, says: "Despuimus comitiales morbos, hoc est,
      contagia regerimus," "We spit out the epilepsy, that is, we avert the
      contagion." This is said, probably, in reference to a belief, that on
      seeing an epileptic person, if we spit, we shall avoid the contagion; but
      it by no means follows that the person so doing must spit upon the
      epileptic person. We read in the first Book of Samuel, ch. xxi., ver. 12:
      "And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of
      Achish, the King of Gath. And he changed his behaviour before them, and
      feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the
      gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard." He probably pretended
      to be attacked with epileptic fits. In fact, after due examination, there
      seems little doubt that it was a common notion with the ancients that the
      distemper was discharged with the saliva.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>To be spit upon</i>)&mdash;Ver. 569. Aristophontes has
      understood the words, "qua spitatur," in the sense of "which is spit
      upon," and asks Tyndarus if he affirms that he is afflicted with a disease
      which requires such treatment. Hegio, to pacify him, and to show off his
      medical knowledge, tells him that it has proved beneficial in some
      diseases to be so treated; but he does not go so far as to say what those
      diseases were. One malady, called "herpes," or "spreading ulcer," was said
      to be highly contagions, but capable of being cured by applications of
      saliva. Some Commentators here quote the method which our Saviour adopted
      in curing the blind man at Bethsaida: "And he took the blind man by the
      hand, and led him out of the town: and when he had spat on his eyes and
      put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught." St. Mark, ch.
      viii., ver. 23. And again, the account given in the ninth chapter of St.
      John, ver. 6: "When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made
      clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the
      clay." It may be possible that our Saviour thought fit to adopt these
      forms, in imitation of some of the methods of treating diseases in those
      times; though, of course, his transcendent power did not require their
      agency. Rost, in his Commentaries on Plautus, has very learned
      disquisition on the meaning of the present passage.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>Alcmaeon, and Orestes, and Lycurgus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 568.
      He alludes to these three persons as being three of the most celebrated
      men of antiquity that were attacked with frenzy. Orestes slew his mother,
      Clytemnestra; Alcmaeon killed his mother, Eriphyle; and Lycurgus, King of
      Thrace, on slighting the worship of Bacchus, was afflicted with madness,
      in a fit of which he hewed off his own legs with a hatchet.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>When he's a slave</i>)&mdash;Ver. 580. Slaves were not
      considered to have any legal existence; and, therefore, to have neither
      parents or relations.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>That I am Liber</i>)&mdash;Ver. 584. Aristophontes asks
      him if he means to assert that he was born a free man, "liber." As "Liber"
      was also a name of Bacchus, Tyndarus quibbles, and says, "I did not assert
      that I am Liber, but that I am Philocrates." In consequence of the idiom
      of the Latin language, his answer (non equidem me Liberam, sed Philocratem
      esse aio) will admit of another quibble, and may be read as meaning, "I
      did not say that I am a free man, but that Philocrates is." This maybe
      readily seen by the Latin scholar, but is not so easily explained to the
      English reader}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>Black bile</i>)&mdash;Ver. 602. A superabundance of the
      bile was supposed to be productive of melancholy madness. The word
      "melancholy" is from the Greek {Greek: melangcholia}, "black bile."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 7: <i>Black pitch</i>)&mdash;Ver. 603. He alludes to a frightful
      punishment inflicted upon malefactors by the Romans. They were either
      smeared over with burning pitch, or were first covered with pitch, which
      was then set fire to. This punishment is supposed to have been often
      inflicted upon the early Christians. Juvena alludes to it in his First
      Satire, I. 155:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Pone Tigellinum, taeda lucebis in illa,
  Qua stantes ardent, qui fixo gutture fumant.
</pre>
    <p>
      Describe Tigellinus {an infamous minister of Nero}, and yon shall give a
      light by those torches, in which those stand and burn who send forth smoke
      with a stake driven into their throat."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 8: <i>Why are you making signs</i>)&mdash;Ver. 617. "Abnutas."
      The verb "abnuto" means, "to nod to a person that he may desist." Tyndarus
      thinks that by this time Aristophontes must surely understand the plan
      that has been devised for the escape of Philocrates; and, as he is about
      to step aside to speak with Hegio, he makes a sign, requesting him to stop
      short in his contradiction of what he has asserted.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 9: <i>The dress only</i>)&mdash;Ver. 620. By "ornamenta" he
      means the dress of Tragedy. The dresses of Comedy were essentially
      different from those of Tragedy. He means to say, "the man is mad; if he
      had only the Tragic garb on, you might take him for Ajax Telamon in his
      frenzy." On being refused the arms of Achilles, Ajax became mad, and
      slaughtered a flock of sheep fancying that they were Ulysses and the sons
      of Atreus.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 10: <i>The sacrifice and the stone</i>)&mdash;Ver. 624. We learn
      from Livy, that in the most ancient times the animal for sacrifice was
      killed by being struck with a stone; to stand between the victim and the
      stone, would consequently imply, to be in a position of extreme danger.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 11: <i>But where is he</i>)&mdash;Ver. 645. Tyndarus has
      probably betaken himself to some corner of the stage, and Aristophontes
      misses him from his former position.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 12: <i>Cut asunder</i>)&mdash;Ver. 646. "Deruncinatus" means,
      literally, cut asunder with a "runcina," or "saw."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 13: <i>Have they imposed upon me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 661. "Os
      sublevere offuciis." Literally "painted my face with varnish." This
      expression is probably derived from the practice of persons concealing
      their defects, by painting over spots or freckles in the face for the
      purpose of hiding them.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 14: <i>Colaphus, Cordalio, Corax</i>)&mdash;Ver. 662. These are
      the names of slaves. "Colaphus" means, also, "a blow with the fist."
      "Corax" was the Greek name for a "crow," and was probably given to a black
      slave.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 15: <i>To gather faggots</i>)&mdash;Ver. 663. He asks this
      question because cords, "lora," were necessary for the purpose of binding
      up faggots.}

    <h3>
      HEG. (<i>to the</i> SLAVES). Put the manacles on this whipp'd villain.
    </h3>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>whilst the</i> SLAVES <i>are fastening him</i>). What's the
      matter? What have I done wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Do you ask the question? You weeder and sower of villanies, and in
      especial their reaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Ought you not to have ventured to say the harrower first? For
      countrymen always harrow before they weed.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Why, with what assurance he stands before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. It's proper for a servant, innocent and guiltless, to be full of
      confidence, most especially before his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to the</i> SLATES). Bind this fellow's hands tightly, will you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I am your own&mdash;do you command them to be cut off even. But what
      is the matter on account of which you blame me?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Because me and my fortunes, so far as in you singly lay, by your
      rascally <i>and</i> knavish stratagems you have rent in pieces, and have
      districted my affairs and spoiled all my resources and my plans, <i>in
      that</i> you've thus robbed me of Philocrates by your devices. I thought
      that he was the slave, you the free man. So did you say yourselves, and in
      this way did you change names between you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I confess that all was done so, as you say, and that by a stratagem
      he has got away from you, through my aid and cleverness; and prithee, now,
      do you blame me for that, i' faith?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Why, it has been done with your extreme torture <i>for the
      consequence</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. So I don't die by reason of my misdeeds, I care but little. If I do
      die here, then he returns not, as he said <i>he would</i>; but when I'm
      dead, this act will be remembered to my honor, that I caused my captive
      master to return from slavery and the foe, a free man, to his father in
      his native land; and that I preferred rather to expose my own life to
      peril, than that he should be undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Take care, then, to enjoy that fame at Acheron.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. He who dies for virtue's sake, still does not perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. When I've tortured you in the most severe manner, and for your
      schemes put you to death, let them say either that you have perished or
      that you have died; so long as you do die, I don't think it matters if
      they say you live.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I' faith, if you do do so, you'll do it not without retribution, if
      he shall return here, as I trust that he will return.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. (<i>aside</i>). O ye immortal Gods! I understand it now; now I know
      what the case <i>really</i> is. My friend Philocrates is at liberty with
      his father, in his native land. 'Tis well; nor have I any person to whom I
      could so readily wish well. But this thing grieves me, that I've done this
      person a bad turn, who now on account of me and my talking is in chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to</i> TYNDARUS). Did I not forbid you this day to utter anything
      false to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. You did forbid me. HEG. Why did you dare to tell me lies?
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Because the truth would have prejudiced him whom I was serving; now
      falsehood has advantaged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. But it will prejudice yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. 'Tis very good. Still, I have saved my master, whom I rejoice at
      being saved, to whom my elder master had assigned me as a protector. But
      do you think that this was wrongly done?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Most wrongfully. TYND. But I, who disagree with you, say, rightly.
      For consider, if any slave of yours had done this for your son, what
      thanks you would have given him. Would you have given that slave his
      freedom or not? Would not that slave have been in highest esteem with you?
      Answer me <i>that.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I think so. TYND. Why, then, are you angry with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Because you have proved more faithful to him than to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. How now? Did you expect, in a single night and day, for yourself to
      teach <i>me</i>&mdash;a person just made captive, a recent <i>slave, and</i>
      in his noviciate&mdash;that I should rather consult your interest than
      his, with whom from childhood I have passed my life?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Seek, then, thanks from him for that. (<i>To the</i> SLAVES.) Take
      him where he may receive weighty and thick fetters, thence, after that,
      you shall go to the quarries for cutting stone. There, while the others
      are digging out eight stones, unless you daily do half as much work again,
      you shall have the name of the six-hundred-stripe man {1}.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. By Gods and men, I do entreat you, Hegio, not to destroy this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. He shall be taken all care of {2}. For at night, fastened with
      chains, he shall be watched; in the daytime, beneath the ground, he shall
      be getting out stone. For many a day will I torture him; I'll not respite
      him for a single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARIST. Is that settled by you? HEG. Not more settled that I shall die. (<i>To
      the</i> SLAVES.) Take him away this instant to Hippolytus, the blacksmith;
      bid thick fetters to be rivetted on him. From there let him be led outside
      the gate to my freedman, Cordalus, at the stone-quarries. And tell him
      that I desire this man so to be treated, that he mayn't be in any respect
      worse off than he who is the most severely treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Why, since you are unwilling, do I desire myself to survive? At your
      own hazard is the risk of my life. After death, no evil have I to
      apprehend in death. Though I should live even to extreme age, still, short
      is the space for enduring what you threaten me with. Farewell and prosper;
      although you are deserving for me to say otherwise. You, Aristophontes, as
      you have deserved of me, so fare you; for on your account has this
      befallen me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to the</i> SLAVES). Carry him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. But this one thing I beg, that, if Philocrates should come back
      here, you will give me an opportunity of meeting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to the</i> SLAVES). At your peril, if you don't this instant
      remove him from my sight. (<i>The</i> SLAVES <i>lay hold of</i> TYNDARUS,
      <i>and push him along.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. I' troth, this really is violence {3}, to be both dragged and pushed
      at the same time. (<i>He is borne off by the</i> SLAVES.)

    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>He shall be taken all care of</i>)&mdash;Ver. 733. Struck
      with admiration at his fidelity, Aristophontes begs Hegio not to destroy
      Tyndarus. As the verb "perduis" might also mean "lose" him, Hegio
      ironically takes it in the latter sense, and says that there is no fear of
      that, for he shall be well taken care of; or, in other words, strictly
      watched.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>This really is violence</i>)&mdash;Ver. 755. According to
      Suetonius, Julius Caesar used an exactly similar expression when first
      attacked by his murderers in the senate-house. On Tullius Cimber seizing
      bold of his garments he exclaimed, "Ita quidem vis est!" "Why, really,
      this is violence!"}

      one presume to attempt such an enterprise. Had it not been for you who
      discovered this to me, still would they have been leading me by the bridle
      with their tricks. Now am I resolved henceforth never to trust any person
      in anything. This once I have been deceived enough; I did hope, to my
      sorrow, that I had rescued my son from slavery. That hope has forsaken me.
      I lost one son, whom, a child in his fourth year, a slave stole from me;
      and, indeed, never since have I found either slave or son; the elder one
      has fallen in the hands of the enemy. What guilt is this <i>of mine</i>?
      As though I had become the father of children for the purpose of being
      childless. (<i>To</i> ARISTOPHONTES.) Follow this way. I'll conduct you

    </h3>
    <p>
      ERG. Supreme Jove! thou dost preserve me, and dost augment my means.
      Plenty, extreme and sumptuous, dost thou present to me; celebrity, profit,
      enjoyment, mirth, festivity, holidays, sights, provisions, carousings,
      abundance, joyousness. And to no man have I now determined with myself to
      go a-begging; for I'm able either to profit my friend or to destroy my
      enemy, to such extent has this delightful day heaped delights upon me in
      its delightfulness. I have lighted upon a most rich inheritance without
      incumbrances {2}. Now will I wend my way to this old gentleman Hegio, to
      whom I am carrying blessings as great as he himself prays for from the
      Gods, and even greater. Now, this is my determination, in the same fashion
      that the slaves of Comedy {3} <i>are wont</i>, so will I throw my cloak
      around my neck, that from me, the first <i>of all</i>, he may learn this
      matter. And I trust that I, by reason of this news, shall find provision
      up to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Ergasilus</i>) He has just come from the harbour, where he
      has seen the son of Hegio, together with Philocrates and Stalagmus,
      landing from the packet-boat. Now, as he speaks still of his intended
      dinner with Hegio, to which he had been invited in the earlier part of the
      Play, we must conclude, that since then, Philocrates has taken ship from
      the coast of Aetolia, arrived in Elis, procured the liberation of
      Philopolemus, and returned with him, all in the space of a few hours.
      This, however, although the coast of Elis was only about fifteen miles
      from that of Aetolia, is not at all consistent with probability; and the
      author has been much censured by some Commentators, especially by Lessing,
      on account of his negligence It must, however, be remembered, that Plautus
      was writing for a Roman audience, the greater part of whom did not know
      whether Elis was one mile or one hundred from the coast of Aetolia. We may
      suppose, too, that Philopolemus had already caused Stalagmus, the runaway
      slave, to be apprehended before the arrival of Philocrates in Elis.}

      when expedition was required, the cloak might not prove an obstruction to
      the wearer as he walked. The slaves in Comedies usually wore the
      "pallium," and as they were mostly active, bustling fellows, would have it
      tucked tightly around them. The "pallium" was usually worn passed over the
      left shoulder, then drawn behind the back, and under the left arm, leaving
      it bare, and then thrown again over the left shoulder.}

      ERG. (<i>advancing, and talking to himself</i>). Throw aside from you all
      tardiness, Ergasilus, and speed on this business. I threaten, and I
      strictly charge no person to stand in my way, unless any one shall be of
      opinion that he has lived long enough. For whoever does come in my way,
      shall stop me upon his face. (<i>He runs along, flourishing his arms
      about.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to himself</i>). This fellow's beginning to box.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. (<i>to himself</i>). I'm determined to do it; so that every one may
      pursue his own path, let no one be bringing any of his business in this
      street; for my fist is a balista, my arm is my catapulta, my shoulder a
      battering-ram; then against whomsoever I dart my knee, I shall bring him
      to the ground. I'll make all persons to be picking up their teeth {1},
      whomsoever I shall meet with.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to himself</i>). What threatening is this? For I cannot wonder
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. I'll make him always to remember this day and place, and myself <i>as
      well</i>. Whoever stops me upon my road, I'll make him put a stop to his
      own existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to himself</i>). What great thing is this fellow preparing to do,
      with such mighty threats?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. I first give notice, that no one, by reason of his own fault, may be
      caught&mdash;keep yourselves in-doors at home, <i>and</i> guard yourselves
      from my attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to himself</i>). By my faith, 'tis strange if he hasn't got this
      boldness by means of his stomach. Woe to that wretched man, through whose
      cheer this fellow has become quite swaggering.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Then the bakers, that feed swine, that fatten their pigs upon refuse
      bran, through the stench of which no one can pass by a baker's shop; if I
      see the pig of any one of them in the public <i>way</i>, I'll beat the
      bran out of the masters' themselves with my fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to himself</i>). Royal and imperial edicts does he give out. The
      fellow is full; he certainly has his boldness from his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Then the fishmongers, who supply stinking fish to the public&mdash;who
      are carried about on a gelding, with his galloping galling pace {2}&mdash;the
      stench of whom drives all the loungers in the Basilica {3} into the Forum,
      I'll bang their heads with their bulrush fish-baskets, that they may
      understand what annoyance they cause to the noses of other people. And
      then the butchers, as well, who render the sheep destitute of their young&mdash;who
      agree with you about killing lamb {4}, and then offer you lamb at double
      the price&mdash;who give the name of wether <i>mutton</i> to a ram&mdash;if
      I should <i>only</i> see that ram in the public way, I'll make both ram
      and owner most miserable beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to himself</i>). Well done! He really does give out edicts fit
      for an Aedile, and 'tis indeed a surprising thing if the Aetolians haven't
      made him inspector of markets {5}.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. No Parasite now am I, but a right royal king of kings; so large a
      stock of provision for my stomach is there at hand in the harbour. But <i>why</i>
      delay to overwhelm this old gentleman Hegio with gladness? With him, not a
      person among mankind exists equally fortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>apart</i>). What joy is this, that he, <i>thus</i> joyous, is
      going to impart to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. (<i>knocking at</i>HEGIO'S <i> door</i>). Hallo, hallo!&mdash;where
      are you? Is any one coming to open this door?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>apart</i>). This fellow's betaking himself to my house to dine.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Open you both these doors {6}, before I shall with knocking cause the
      destruction, piecemeal, of the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>apart</i>). I'd like much to address the fellow. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
      Ergasilus!
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Who's calling Ergasilus?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. <i>Turn round, and</i> look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. (<i>not seeing who it is</i>). A thing that Fortune does not do for
      you, nor <i>ever</i> will do, you bid me <i>to do</i>. But who is it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Look round at me. 'Tis Hegio.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. (<i>turning round</i>). O me! Best of the very best of men, as many
      as exist, you have arrived opportunely.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. You've met with some one at the harbour to dine with; through that
      you are elevated.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Give me your hand. HEG. My hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Give me your hand, I say, this instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Take it. (<i>Giving him his hand.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Rejoice. HEG. Why should I rejoice?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Because I bid you; come now, rejoice.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I' faith, my sorrows exceed my rejoicings.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. 'Tis not so, <i>as</i> you shall find; I'll at once drive away every
      spot of sorrow {7} from your body. Rejoice without restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I do rejoice, although I don't at all know why I should rejoice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. You do rightly; <i>now</i> order&mdash;HEG. Order what?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. A large fire to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. A large fire? ERG. So I say, that a huge one it must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. What, you vulture, do you suppose that for your sake I'm going to set
      my house on fire?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Don't be angry. Will you order, or will you not order, the pots to be
      put on, <i>and</i> the saucepans to be washed out, the bacon and the
      dainties to be made warm in the heated cooking-stoves, another one, <i>too</i>,
      to go purchase the fish?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. This fellow's dreaming while awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Another to buy pork, and lamb, and pullets.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. You understand how to feed well, if you had the means.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Gammons of bacon, <i>too</i>, and lampreys, spring pickled
      tunny-fish, mackerel, and sting-ray; large fish, too, and soft cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. You will have more opportunity, Ergasilus, here at my house, of
      talking about these things than of eating them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Do you suppose that I'm saying this on my own account?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. You will neither be eating nothing here to-day, nor yet much more <i>than
      usual, so</i> don't you be mistaken. Do you then bring an appetite to my
      house for your every-day fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Why, I'll so manage it, that you yourself shall wish to be profuse,
      though I myself should desire you not.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. What, I? ERG. Yes, you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Then you are my master. ERG. Yes, <i>and</i> a kindly disposed one.
      Do you wish me to make you happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Certainly I would, rather than miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Give me your hand. HEG. (<i>extending his hand</i>) Here is my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. All the Gods are blessing you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I don't feel it so. ERG. Why, you are not in a quickset hedge,{8}
      therefore you don't feel it; but order the vessels, in a clean state, to
      be got for you forthwith in readiness for the sacrifice, and one lamb to
      be brought here with all haste, a fat one.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Why? ERG. That you may offer sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. To which one of the Gods?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. To myself, i' faith, for now am I your supreme Jupiter. I likewise am
      your salvation, your fortune, your life, your delight, your joy. Do you at
      once, then, make this Divinity propitious to you by cramming him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEU. You seem to me to be hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. For myself am I hungry, <i>and</i> not for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I readily allow of it at your own good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. I believe you; from a boy you were in the habit&mdash;{9}
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. May Jupiter and the Gods confound you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. I' troth, 'tis fair that for my news you should return me thanks;
      such great happiness do I now bring you from the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Now you are flattering me. Begone, you simpleton; you have arrived
      behind time, too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. If I had come sooner, then for that reason you might rather have said
      that. Now, receive this joyous <i>news</i> of me which I bring <i>you</i>;
      for at the harbour I just now saw your son Philopolemus in the common
      fly-boat, alive, safe and sound, and likewise there that other young man
      together with him, and Stalagmus your slave, who fled from your house, who
      stole from you your little son, the child of four years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Away with you to utter perdition! You are trifling with me
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. So may holy Gluttony {10} love me, Hegio, and so may she ever dignify
      me with her name, I did see&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. My son? ERG. Your son, and my <i>good</i> Genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. That Elean captive, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Yes, by Apollo. {11}
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. The slave, too? My <i>slave</i> Stalagmus, he that stole my son&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Yes, by Cora HEG. So long a time ago?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Yes, by Praeneste! HEG. Is he arrived?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Yes, by Signia! HEG. For sure?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Yes, by Phrysinone! HEG. Have a care, if you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Yes, by Alatrium! HEG. Why are you swearing by foreign cities?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Why, because they are just as disagreable as you were declaring your
      fare to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Woe be to you! ERG. Because that you don't believe me at all in what
      I say in sober earnestness. But of what country was Stalagmus, at the time
      when he departed hence?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. A Sicilian. ERG. But now he is not a Sicilian&mdash;he is a Boian; he
      has got a Boian woman {12}. A wife, I suppose, has been given to him for
      the sake of obtaining children.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Tell me, have you said these words to me in good earnest?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. In good <i>earnest</i>. HEG. Immortal Gods, I seem to be born again,
      if you are telling the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Do you say so? Will you still entertain doubts, when I have solemnly
      sworn to you? In fine, Hegio, if you have little confidence in my oath, go
      yourself to the harbour and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I'm determined to do so. Do you arrange in-doors what's requisite.
      Use, ask for, take <i>from my larder</i> what you like; I appoint you
      cellarman.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Now, by my troth, if I have not prophesied truly to you, do you comb
      me out with a cudgel.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I'll find you in victuals to the end, if you are telling me the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Whence <i>shall</i> it <i>be</i>? HEG. From myself and from my son.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. Do you promise that? HEG. I do promise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. But I, in return, promise {13} you that your son has arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Manage as well as ever you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERG. A happy walk <i>there</i> to you, and <i>a happy</i> walk back.
    </p>

    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>To be picking up their teeth</i>)&mdash;Ver. 803.
      "Dentilegos." He says that he will knock their teeth out, and so make them
      pick them up from the ground. We must suppose that while he is thus
      hurrying on, he is walking up one of the long streets which were
      represented as emerging on the Roman stage, opposite to the audience.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Galling pace</i>)&mdash;Ver. 819. "Crucianti" may mean
      either "tormenting" the spectator by reason of the slowness of its pace,
      or galling to the rider. "Quadrupedanti crucianti cauterio" is a phrase,
      both in sound and meaning, much resembling what our song-books call the
      "galloping dreary dun."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>In the Basilica</i>)&mdash;Ver. 820. The "Basilica" was a
      building which served as a court of law, and a place of meeting for
      merchants and men of business. The name was perhaps derived from the Greek
      word <i>Basileus</i>, as the title of the second Athenian Archon, who had
      his tribunal or court of justice. The building was probably, in its
      original form, an insulated portico. The first edifice of this kind at
      Rome was erected B.C. 184; probably about the period when this Play was
      composed. It was situate in the Forum, and was built by Porcius Cato, from
      whom it was called the "Porcian Basilica." Twenty others were afterwards
      erected at different periods in the city. The loungers here mentioned, in
      the present instance, were probably sauntering about under the porticos of
      the Basilica, when their olfactory nerves were offended by the unsavoury
      smell of the fishermen's baskets.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>About killing lamb</i>)&mdash;Ver. 824. In these lines he
      seems to accuse the butchers of three faults&mdash;cruelty, knavery, and
      extortion. The general reading is "duplam," but Rost suggests "dupla," "at
      double the price." If "duplam" is retained, might it not possibly mean
      that the butchers agree to kill lamb for you, and bring to you "duplam
      agninam," "double lamb," or, in other words, lamb twice as old as it ought
      to be? No doubt there was some particular age at which lamb, in the
      estimation of Ergasilus and his brother-epicures, was considered to be in
      its greatest perfection.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>Inspector of markets</i>)&mdash;Ver. 829. "Agoranomum."
      The Aediles were the inspectors of markets at Rome, while the "Agoranomi"
      had a similar office in the Grecian cities.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>Both these doors</i>)&mdash;Ver. 836. The street-doors of
      the ancients were generally "bivalve," or "folding-doors."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 7: Every spot of sorrow )&mdash;Ver. 846. He alludes,
      figuratively, to the art of the fuller or scourer, in taking the spots out
      of soiled garments.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 8: <i>In a quickset hedge</i>)&mdash;Ver. 865. Here is a most
      wretched attempt at wit, which cannot be expressed in a literal
      translation. Hegio says, "Nihil sentio," "I don't feel it." Ergasilus
      plays upon the resemblance of the verb "sentio" to "sentis" and
      "senticetum," a "bramble-bush" or "quickset hedge;" and says, 'You don't
      feel it so," "non sentis," "because you are not in a quickset hedge,' "in
      senticeto." }
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 9: <i>From a boy</i>)&mdash;Ver. 872. An indelicate allusion is
      covertly intended in this line. }
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 10: <i>So may holy Gluttony</i>&mdash;Ver. 882. The Parasite
      very appropriately deifies Gluttony: as the Goddess of Bellyful would, of
      course, merit his constant worship.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 11: <i>Yes, by Apollo</i>)&mdash;Ver. 885. In the exuberance of
      his joy at his prospects of good eating, the Parasite gives this, and his
      next five replies, in the Greek language; just as the diner-out, and the
      man of bon-mots and repartee, might in our day couch his replies in
      French, with the shrug of the shoulder and the becoming grimace. He first
      swears by Apollo, and then by Cora, which may mean either a city of
      Campania so called, or the Goddess Proserpine, who was called by the
      Greeks, {Greek: Korae}, "the maiden." He then swears by four places in
      Campania&mdash;Praeneste, Signia, Phrysinone, and Alatrium. As the scene
      is in Greece, Hegio asks him why he swears by these foreign places; to
      which he gives answer merely because they are as disagreable as the
      unsavoury dinner of vegetables which he had some time since promised him.
      This is, probably, merely an excuse for obtruding a slighting remark upon
      these places, which would meet with a ready response from a Roman
      audience, as the Campanians had sided with Hannibal against Rome in the
      second Punic war. They were probably miserable places on which the more
      refined Romans looked with supreme contempt.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 12: <i>Got a Boian woman</i>)&mdash;Vet. 893. There is an
      indelicate meaning in the expression "Buiam terere." The whole line is
      intended as a play upon words. "Boia" means either "a collar," which was
      placed round a prisoner's neck, or a female of the nation of the Boii in
      Gaul. "Boiam terere" may mean either "to have the prisoner's collar on,"
      or, paraphrastically, "to be coupled with a Boian woman." Ergasilus having
      seen Stalagmus in the packet-boat with this collar on, declares that
      Stalagmus is a Sicilian no longer, for he has turned Boian, having a Boian
      helpmate.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 13: <i>I, in return, promise</i>)&mdash;Ver. 904. Ergasilus
      says, "Do you really promise me this fine entertainment?" To which, Hegio
      answers, "Spondeo," "I do promise." On this, Ergasilus replies, "that your
      son really has returned, I answer you," "respondeo," or, as he intends it
      to be meant, "I promise you once again," or "in return for your promise."}

      ERG. He has gone away from here, <i>and</i> has entrusted to me the most
      important concern of catering. Immortal Gods! how I shall now be slicing
      necks off of sides; how vast a downfall will befall the gammon {1}; how
      vast a belabouring the bacon! How great a using-up of udders, how vast a

      great a <i>preparation</i> for the pork-sellers! But if I were to
      enumerate the rest of the things which minister to the supply of the
      stomach, 'twould be <i>sheer</i> delay. Now will I go off to my

      the spirit of the passage, the literal meaning may be here stated. "Pernis
      pestis," "a plague to the gammons;" "labes larido," "a fall for the
      bacon;" "sumini absumedo," "a consumption of udder;" "callo calamitas,"
      "destruction to the brawn;" and "laniis lassitudo," "weariness to the
      butchers." Sows' udder, with the milk in it, first dried, and then cooked
      in some peculiar manner, was considered a great delicacy by the Roman
      epicures.}

    <p>
      LAD. May Jupiter and the Deities confound you, Ergasilus, and your
      stomach, and all Parasites, and <i>every one</i> who henceforth shall give
      a dinner to Parasites. Destruction and devastation <i>and</i> ruin have
      just now entered our house. I was afraid that he would be making an attack
      on me, as though he had been an hungry wolf. And very dreadfully, upon my
      faith, was I frightened at him; he made such a gnashing with his teeth. On
      his arrival, the whole larder, with the meat, he turned upside down. He
      seized a knife, and first cut off the kernels of the neck {1} from three
      sides. All the pots and cups he broke, except those that held a couple of
      gallons {2}; of the cook he made enquiry whether the salting pans could <i>be
      set on the fire</i> to be made hot. All the cellars in the house he has
      broken into, and has laid the store-closet {3} open. (<i>At the door.</i>)
      Watch him, servants, if you please; I'll go to meet the old gentleman.
      I'll tell him to get ready some provisions for his own self, if, indeed,
      he wishes himself to make use of any. For in this place, as this man,
      indeed, is managing, either there's nothing already, or very soon there
      will be nothing. (<i>Exit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>The kernels of the neck</i>)&mdash;Ver. 920. The "glandia"
      were the kernels or tonsils of the throat, situate just below the root of
      the tongue. These portions of the dead pig seem to have been much prized
      as delicate eating. Judging from the present passage, the whole side of
      the pig, including the half-head, was salted and dried in one piece: The
      first thing that the Parasite does, is to cut the kernels from off of
      three sides, which he has relieved from the punishment of hanging.}

      {Footnote 3: <i>The store-closet</i>)&mdash;Ver. 923. "Armarium" was to
      called because it was originally a place for keeping arms. It afterwards
      came to signify a cupboard in a wall, in which clothes, books, money, and
      other articles of value, were placed. It was generally in the "atrium," or

    </h2>
    <h3>
      STALAGMUS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      HEG. To Jove and to the Deities I return with reason hearty thanks,
      inasmuch as they have restored you to your father, and inasmuch as they
      have delivered me from very many afflictions, which, while I was obliged
      to be here without you, I was enduring, and inasmuch as I see that that <i>fellow</i>
      (<i>pointing to</i> STALAGMUS) is in my power, and inasmuch as his word (<i>pointing
      to</i> PHILOCRATES) has been found true to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILOP. Enough now have I grieved from my very soul, and enough with care
      and tears have I disquieted myself. Enough now have I heard of your woes,
      which at the harbour you told me of. Let us now to this business.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. What now, since I've kept my word with you, and have caused him to
      be restored back again to freedom?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Philocrates, you have acted so that I can never return you thanks
      enough, in the degree that you merit from myself and my son.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILOP. Nay, but you can, father, and you will be able, and I shall be
      able; and the Divinities will give the means for you to return the
      kindness he merits to one who deserves so highly of us; as, my father, you
      are able to do to this person who so especially deserves it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. What need is there of words? I have no tongue with which to deny
      whatever you may ask <i>of me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I ask of you to restore to me that servant whom I left here as a
      surety for myself; who has always proved more faithful to me than to
      himself; in order that for his services I may be enabled to give him a
      reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Because you have acted <i>thus</i> kindly, the favour shall be
      returned, the thing that you ask; both that and anything else that you
      shall ask of me, you shall obtain. And I would not have you blame me,
      because in my anger I have treated him harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. What have you done? HEG. I confined him in fetters at the
      stone-quarries, when I found out that I had been imposed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Ah wretched me! That for my safety misfortunes should have happened
      to that best of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Now, on this account, you need not give me even <i>one</i> groat of
      silver {1} for him. Receive him of me without cost that he may be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. On my word, Hegio, you act with kindness; but I entreat that you
      will order <i>this</i> man to be sent for.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Certainly. (<i>To the attendants, who immediately obey.</i>) Where
      are you? Go this instant, <i>and</i> bring Tyndarus here. (To PHILOPOLEMUS
      and PHILOCRATES.) Do you go in-doors; in the meantime, I wish to enquire
      of this statue for whipping {2}, what was done with my younger son. Do you
      go bathe in the meantime.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILOP. Philocrates, follow me this way in-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. I follow you. (<i>They go into the house.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>One groat of silver</i>)&mdash;Ver. 952. "Libella" was the
      name of the smallest silver coin with the Romans, being the tenth part of
      a denarius. Hegio seems to make something of a favour of this, and to give
      his liberty to Tyndarus in consideration of his punishment; whereas he had
      originally agreed with Philocrates that, if Philopolemus was liberated,
      both he and Tyndarus should be set at liberty.}

    </h2>
    <h3>
      HEG. Come you, step this way, you worthy fellow, my fine slave.
    </h3>
    <p>
      STAL. What is fitting for me to do, when you, such a man as you are, are
      speaking false? I was never a handsome <i>or</i> a fine, <i>or</i> a good
      person, <i>or</i> an honest one, nor shall I ever be; assuredly, don't you
      be forming any hopes that I shall be honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. You easily understand pretty well in what situation your fortunes
      are. If you shall prove truth-telling, you'll make your lot from bad
      somewhat better. Speak out, <i>then</i>, correctly and truthfully; but
      never yet truthfully or correctly have you acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. Do you think that I'm ashamed to own it, when you affirm it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. But I'll make you to be ashamed; for I'll cause you to be blushes all
      over {1}.
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. Heyday&mdash;you're threatening stripes, I suppose, to me, <i>quite</i>
      unaccustomed to them! Away with them, I beg. Tell me what you bring, that
      you may carry off hence what you are in want of.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Very fluent <i>indeed</i>. But now I wish this prating to be cut
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. As you desire, so be it done.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to the</i> AUDIENCE). As a boy he was very obedient {2}; now that
      suits him not. Let's to this business; now give your attention, and inform
      me upon what I ask. If you tell the truth, you'll make your fortunes
      somewhat better.
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. That's <i>mere</i> trifling. Don't you think that I know what I'm
      deserving of?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Still, it is in your power to escape a small portion of it, if not
      the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. A small portion I shall escape, I know; but much will befall me, and
      with my deserving it, because I both ran away, and stole your son and sold
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. To what person? STAL. To Theodoromedes the Polyplusian, in Elis, for
      six minae.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. O ye immortal Gods! He surely is the father of this person,
      Philocrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. Why, I know him better than yourself, and have seen him more times.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Supreme Jove, preserve both myself and my son for me. (<i>He goes to
      the door, and calls aloud.</i>) Philocrates, by your <i>good</i> Genius, I
      do entreat you, come out, I want you.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Be blushes all over</i>)&mdash;Ver. 967. He means that he
      will have him flogged until he is red all over.}

    <h3>
      PHIL. Hegio, here am I; if you want anything of me, command me.
    </h3>
    <p>
      HEG. He (<i>pointing to</i> STALAGMUS) declares that he sold my son to
      your father, in Elis, for six minae.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. (to STALAGMUS). How long since did that happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. This is the twentieth year, commencing <i>from it</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. He is speaking falsely. STAL. Either I or you <i>do</i>. Why, your
      father gave you the little child, of four years old, to be your own slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. What was his name? If you are speaking the truth, tell me that,
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. Paegnium, he used to be called; afterwards, you gave him the name of
      Tyndarus.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Why don't I recollect you? STAL. Because it's the fashion for
      persons to forget, and not to know him whose favour is esteemed as worth
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Tell me, was he the person whom you sold to my father, who was given
      me for my private service?
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. <i>It was</i> his son (<i>pointing to</i> HEGIO).
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Is this person now living? STAL. I received the money. I cared
      nothing about the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. (<i>to</i> PHILOCRATES). What do you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Why, this very Tyndarus is your son, according, indeed, to the
      proofs that he mentions. For, a boy <i>himself</i> together with me from
      boyhood was he brought up, virtuously and modestly, even to manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I am both unhappy and happy, if you are telling the truth. Unhappy
      for this reason, because, if he is my son, I have badly treated him. Alas!
      why have I done both more and less than was his due. That I have ill
      treated him I am grieved; would that it only could be undone. But see,
      he's coming here, in a guise not according to his deserts.

    </h2>
    <p>
      TYND. (<i>to himself</i>). I have seen many of the torments which take
      place at Acheron {1} often represented in paintings {2}; but most
      certainly there is no Acheron equal to where I have been in the
      stone-quarries. There, in fine, is the place where real lassitude must be
      undergone by the body in laboriousness. For when I came there, just as
      either jackdaws, or ducks, or quails, are given to Patrician children {3},
      for them to play with, so in like fashion, when I arrived, a crow was
      given {4} me with which to amuse myself. But see, my master's before the
      door; and lo! my other master has returned from Elis.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. Hail to you, my much wished-for son.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. Ha! how&mdash;my son? Aye, aye, I know why you pretend yourself to
      be the father, and me to be the son; <i>it is</i> because, just as parents
      do, you give me the means of seeing the light{5}.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Hail to you, Tyndarus. TYND. And to you, for whose sake I am
      enduring these miseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. But now I'll make you in freedom come to wealth. For (<i>pointing to</i>
      HEGIO) this is your father; (<i>pointing to</i> STALAGMUS) that is the
      slave who stole you away from here when four years old, <i>and</i> sold
      you to my father for six minae. He gave you, when a little child, to me a
      little child, for my own service. He (<i>pointing to</i> STALAGMUS). has
      made a confession, for we have brought him back from Elis.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. How, where's <i>Hegio's</i> son? PHIL. Look <i>now</i>; in-doors is
      your own brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. How do you say? Have you brought that captive son of his?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. Why, he's in-doors, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. By my faith, you're done both well and happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. (<i>pointing to</i> HEGIO). Now this is your own father; (<i>pointing
      to</i> STALAGMUS) this is the thief who stole you when a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      TYND. But now, grown up, I shall give him grown up to the executioner for
      his thieving.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHIL. He deserves it. TYND. I' faith, I'll deservedly give him the reward
      that he deserves. (<i>To</i> HEGIO.) But tell me I pray you, are you my
      father?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG, I am he, my son. TYND. Now, at length, I bring it to my recollection,
      when I reconsider with myself: troth, I do now at last recall to memory
      that I had heard, as though through a mist, that my father was called
      Hegio.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I am he. PHIL. I pray that your son may be lightened of these
      fetters, and this slave be loaded with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEG. I'm resolved that that shall be the first thing attended to. Let's go
      in-doors, that the blacksmith may be sent for, in order that I may remove
      those fetters from you, and give them to him. (<i>They go into the house.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      STAL. To one who has no savings <i>of his own</i>, you'll be rightly doing
      so {6}.

    <p>
      <i>The</i> COMPANY <i>of</i> PLAYERS <i>coming forward.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Spectators, this play is founded on chaste manners. No wenching is there
      in this, and no intriguing, no exposure of a child, no cheating out of
      money; and no young man in love here make his mistress free without his
      father's knowledge. The Poets find but few Comedies {7} of this kind,
      where good men might become better. Now, if it pleases you, and if we have
      pleased you, and have not been tedious, do you give this sign <i>of it</i>:
      you who wish that chaste manners should have their reward, give <i>us</i>
      your applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>At Acheron</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1003. He here speaks of
      Acheron, not as one of the rivers of hell, but as the infernal regions
      themselves.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Represented in paintings</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1003 Meursius
      thinks that the torments of the infernal regions were frequently
      represented in pictures, for the purpose of deterring men from evil
      actions, by keeping in view the certain consequences of their bad
      conduct.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>To Patrician children</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1007. This passage
      is confirmed by what Pliny the Younger tells us in his Second Epistle. He
      says, that on the death of the son of Regulus, his father, in his grief,
      caused his favourite ponies and dogs, with his nightingales, parrots, and
      jackdaws, to be consumed on the funeral pile. It would certainly have been
      a greater compliment to his son's memory had he preserved them, and
      treated them kindly; but probably he intended to despatch them as
      playthings for the child in the other world.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>A crow was given</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1009. "Upupa." He puns
      upon the twofold meaning of this word, which signified either "a mattock"
      or a bird called a "hoopoe," according to the context. To preserve the
      spirit of the pun, a somewhat different translation has been given.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>Of seeing the light</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1013. He says, "You
      can only resemble a parent in the fact that you have given me the
      opportunity of seeing the light of day, by taking me out of the dark
      stone-quarries."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>Be rightly doing so</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1033. Stalagmus
      chooses to take the word "dem" "may give," used by Hegio in its literal
      sense, and surlily replies, "I have nothing of my own by way of savings,
      'peculium,' so I am the very person to whom you ought to give."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 7: <i>Find but few Comedies</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1038. He here
      confesses that he does not pretend to frame the plots of his Plays
      himself, but that he goes to Greek sources for them; and forgetting that
      "beggars most not be choosers," he complains that so very few of the Greek
      Comedies are founded upon chaste manners. Indeed, this Play is justly
      deemed the most pure and innocent of all the Plays of Plautus; and the
      Company are quite justified in the commendations which, in their Epilogue,
      they bestow on it, as the author has carried out the premise which he made
      in the Prologue (with only four slight exceptions), of presenting them
      with an immaculate Play.}

      ACT I.&mdash;SCENE I. <i>Enter, from the house of</i> THEUROPIDES, GRUMIO,
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>pushing out</i> TRANIO.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. Get out of the kitchen, will you; out of it, <i>you</i>
      whip-scoundrel, who are giving me your cavilling talk amid the platters;
      march out of the house, you ruin of your master. Upon my faith, if I <i>only</i>
      live, I'll be soundly revenged upon you in the country. Get out, I say,
      you steam of the kitchen. Why are you skulking <i>thus</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why the plague are you making <i>this</i> noise here before the
      house? Do you fancy yourself to be in the country{1}? Get out of the
      house; be off into the country. Go and hang yourself. Get away from the
      door. (<i>Striking him</i>.) There now, was it that you wanted?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. (<i>running away</i>). I'm undone! Why are you beating me? TRA.
      Because you want it.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. I must endure it. Only let the old gentleman return <i>home</i>; only
      let him come safe <i>home</i>, whom you are devouring in his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. You don't say what's either likely or true, you blockhead, as to any
      one devouring a person in his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. Indeed, you town wit, you minion of the mob, do you throw the country
      in my teeth? Really, Tranio, I do believe that you feel sure that before
      long you'll be handed over to the mill. Within a short period, i' faith,
      Tranio, you'll full soon be adding to the iron-bound race {2} in the
      country. While you choose to, and have the opportunity, drink on, squander
      his property, corrupt my master's son, a most worthy young man, drink
      night and day, live like Greeks {3}, make purchase of mistresses, give
      them their freedom, feed parasites, feast yourselves sumptuously. Was it
      thus that the old gentleman enjoined you when he went hence abroad? Is it
      after this fashion that he will find his property well husbanded? Do you
      suppose that this is the duty of a good servant, to be ruining both the
      estate and the son of his master? For I do consider him as ruined, when he
      devotes himself to these goings on. <i>A person</i>, with whom not one of
      all the young men of Attica was before deemed equally frugal or more
      steady, the same is now carrying off the palm in the opposite direction.
      Through your management and your tutoring has that been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What the plague business have you with me or with, what I do?
      Prithee, haven't you got <i>your</i> cattle in the country for you to look
      to? I choose to drink, to intrigue, to keep my wenches; this I do at the
      peril of my own back, <i>and</i> not of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. Then with what assurance he does talk! (<i>Turning away in disgust.</i>)
      Faugh!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. But may Jupiter and all the Deities confound you; you stink of
      garlick, you filth unmistakeable, you clod, you he-goat, you pig-sty, you
      mixture of dog and she-goat.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. What would you have to be done? It isn't all that can smell of
      foreign perfumes, if you smell of them; or that can take their places at
      table above their master, or live on such exquisite dainties as you live
      upon. Do you keep to yourself those turtle-doves, <i>that</i> fish, <i>and</i>
      poultry; let me enjoy my lot upon garlick diet. You are fortunate; I
      unlucky. It must be endured. Let my good fortune be awaiting me, your bad
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. You seem, Grumio, as though you envied me, because I enjoy myself and
      you are wretched. It is quite my due. It's proper for me to make love, and
      for you to feed the cattle; for me to fare handsomely, you in a miserable
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. O riddle for the executioner {4}, as I guess it will turn out;
      they'll be so pinking you with goads, as you carry your gibbet {5} along
      the streets one day, as soon as ever the old gentleman returns here.
    </p>
    <p>
      TERA. How do you know whether that mayn't happen to yourself sooner than
      to me? GRU. Because I have never deserved it; you have deserved it, and
      you now deserve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Do cut short the trouble of your talking, unless you wish a heavy
      mischance to befall you.
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. Are you going to give me the tares for me to take for the cattle? If
      you are not, give me the money. Go on, still persist in the way in which
      you've commenced! Drink, live like Greeks, eat, stuff yourselves,
      slaughter your fatlings!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Hold your tongue, and be off into the country; I intend to go to the
      Piraeus to get me some fish for the evening. To-morrow I'll make some one
      bring you the tares to the farm. What's the matter? Why now are you
      staring at me, gallows-bird?
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. I' faith, I've an idea that will be your own title before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. So long as it is as it is, in the meantime I'll put up with that
      "before long."
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. That's the way; and understand this one thing, that that which is
      disagreable comes much more speedily than that which you wish for.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Don't you be annoying; now then, away with you into the country, and
      betake yourself off. Don't you deceive yourself, henceforth you shan't be
      causing me <i>any</i> impediment. (<i>Exit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      GRU. (<i>to himself</i>). Is he really gone? Not to care one straw for
      what I've said! O immortal Gods, I do implore your aid, do cause this old
      gentleman of ours, who has now been three years absent from here, to
      return hither as soon as possible, before everything is gone, both house
      and land. Unless he does return here, remnants to last for a few months <i>only</i>
      are left. Now I'll be off to the country; but look! I see my master's son,
      one who has been corrupted from having been a most excellent young man. (<i>Exit.</i>

    <h2>
      SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Enter</i> PHILOLACHES, <i>from the house of</i>
      THEUROPIDES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      PHIL. (<i>to himself</i>). I've often thought and long reflected on it,
      and in my breast have held many a debate, and in my heart (if any heart I
      have) have revolved this matter, and long discussed it, to what thing I'm
      to consider man as like, and what form he has when he is born? I've now
      discovered this likeness. I think a man is like unto a new house when he
      is born. I'll give my proofs of this fact. (<i>To the</i> AUDIENCE.) And
      does not this seem to you like the truth? But so I'll manage that you
      shall think it is so. Beyond a doubt I'll convince you that it is true
      what I say. And this yourselves, I'm sure, when you have heard my words,
      will say is no otherwise than just as I now affirm that it is. Listen
      while I repeat my proofs of this fact; I want you to be equally knowing
      with myself upon this matter. As soon as ever a house is built up, nicely
      polished off {1}, carefully erected, <i>and</i> according to rule, people
      praise the architect and approve of the house, they take from it each one
      a model for himself. Each one <i>has</i> something similar, quite at his
      own expense; they do not spare their pains. But when a worthless, lazy,
      dirty, negligent fellow betakes himself thither with an idle family, then
      is it imputed as a fault to the house, while a good <i>house</i> is being
      kept in bad repair. And this is often the case; a storm comes on and
      breaks the tiles and gutters; then a careless owner takes no heed to put
      up others. A shower comes on <i>and</i> streams down the walls; the
      rafters admit the rain; the weather rots the labours of the builder; then
      the utility of the house becomes diminished; and yet this is not the fault
      of the builder. But a great part <i>of mankind</i> have contracted this <i>habit
      of</i> delay; if anything can be repaired by means of money, they are
      always still putting it off, and don't * * * do it until the walls come
      tumbling down {2}; <i>then</i> the whole house has to be built anew. These
      instances from buildings I've mentioned; and now I wish to inform you how
      you are to suppose that men are like houses. In the first place then, the
      parents are the builders-up of the children, and lay the foundation for
      the children; they raise them up, they carefully train them to strength,
      and that they may be good both for service and for view before the public.
      They spare not either their own pains or their cost, nor do they deem
      expense in that to be an expense. They refine them, teach them literature,
      the ordinances, the laws; at their own cost and labour they struggle, that
      others may wish for their own <i>children</i> to be like to them. When
      they repair to the army, they then find them some relation {3} of theirs
      as a protector. At that moment they pass out of the builder's hands. One
      year's pay has <i>now</i> been earned; at that period, then, a sample is
      on view how the building will turn out. But I was always discreet and
      virtuous, just as long as I was under the management of the builder. After
      I had left him to follow the bent of my own inclinations, at once I
      entirely spoiled the labours of the builders. Idleness came on; that was
      my storm; on its arrival, upon me it brought down hail <i>and</i> showers,
      which overthrew my modesty and the bounds of virtue, and untiled them for
      me in an instant. After that I was neglectful to cover in <i>again</i>; at
      once passion like a torrent entered my heart; it flowed down even unto my
      breast, <i>and</i> soaked through my heart. Now both property, credit,
      fair fame, virtue, <i>and</i> honor have forsaken <i>me</i>; by usage have
      I become much worse, and, i' faith (so rotten are these rafters of <i>mine</i>
      with moisture), I do not seem to myself to be able possibly to patch up my
      house to <i>prevent it</i> from falling down totally once for all, from
      perishing from the foundation, <i>and</i> from no one being able to assist
      me. My heart pains me, when I reflect how I now am and how I <i>once</i>
      was, than whom in youthful age not one there was more active in the arts
      of exercise {4}, with the quoit, the javelin, the ball, racing, arms, <i>and</i>
      horses. I <i>then</i> lived a joyous life {5}; in frugality and hardihood
      I was an example to others; all, even the most deserving, took a lesson
      from me for themselves. Now that I'm become worthless, to that, indeed,
      have I hastened through the bent of my inclinations. (<i>He stands apart.</i>)

      {Footnote 1: <i>Polished off</i>)&mdash;Ver. 98. From this passage it
      would seem that pains were taken to give the houses a smooth and polished
      appearance on the outside.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Walls come tumbling down</i>)&mdash;Ver. 114. Warner
      remarks that a sentiment not unlike this is found in Scripture,
      Ecclesiastes, x. 18: "By much slothfulness, the building decayeth; and
      through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through." It may be also
      observed that the passage is very similar to the words of the parable of
      the foolish man who built his house upon sand, St. Matthew, vii. 26: "And
      the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon
      that house, and it fell; and great was the fall thereof."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>Find them some relation</i>)&mdash;Ver. 127. In the first
      year of military service the Roman youths were placed under the tutelage
      of some relation or friend.}

      {Footnote 5: <i>Lived a joyous life</i>)&mdash;Ver. 148. "Victitabam

    </h2>
    <p>
      for a toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. On my word, for this long time I've not bathed in cold water with
      more delight <i>than just now</i>; nor do I think that I ever was, my <i>dear</i>
      Scapha, more thoroughly cleansed <i>than now</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. May the upshot of everything be <i>unto you</i> like a plenteous
      year's harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. What has this harvest got to do with my bathing?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Not a bit more than your bathing <i>has to do</i> with the harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). O beauteous Venus, this is that storm of mine which
      stripped off all the modesty with which I was roofed; through which Desire
      and Cupid poured their shower into my breast; and never since have I been
      able to roof it in. Now are my walls soaking in my heart; this building is
      utterly undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Do look, my Scapha, there's a dear, whether this dress quite
      becomes me. I wish to please Philolaches my protector, the apple of my
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Nay but, you set yourself off to advantage with pleasing manners,
      inasmuch as you yourself are pleasing. The lover isn't in love with a
      woman's dress, but with that which stuffs out {1}the dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). So may the Gods bless me, Scapha is waggish; the
      hussy's quite knowing. How cleverly she understands all matters, the
      maxims of lovers too!
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Well now? SCA. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Why look at me and examine, how this becomes me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Thanks to your good looks, it happens that whatever you put on
      becomes you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). Now then, for that expression, Scapha, I'll make
      you some present or other to-day, and I won't allow you to have praised
      her for nothing who is so pleasing to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. I don't want you to flatter me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Really you are a very simple woman. Come now, would you rather be
      censured undeservedly, than be praised with truth? Upon thy faith, for my
      own part, even though undeservedly, I'd much rather be praised than be
      found fault with with reason, or that other people should laugh at my
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. I love the truth; I wish the truth to be told me; I detest a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. So may you love me, <i>and</i> so may your Philolaches love you, how
      charming you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). How say you, you hussy? In what words did you
      adjure? "So may I love her?" Why wasn't "So may she <i>love</i> me" added
      as well? I revoke the present. What I just now promised you is done for;
      you have lost the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Troth, for my part I am surprised that you, a person so knowing, so
      clever, and <i>so</i> well educated, are not aware that you are acting
      foolishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Then give me your advice, I beg, if I have done wrong in anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I' faith, you certainly do wrong, in setting your mind upon him
      alone, in fact, and humouring him in particular in this way and slighting
      other men. It's the part of a married woman, <i>and</i> not of courtesans,
      to be devoted to a single lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). O Jupiter! Why, what pest is this that has befallen
      my house? May all the Gods and Goddesses destroy me in the worst of
      fashions, if I don't kill this old hag with thirst, and hunger, and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. I don't want you, Scapha, to be giving me bad advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. You are clearly a simpleton, in thinking that he'll for everlasting
      be your friend and well-wisher. I warn you <i>of that</i>; he'll forsake
      you by reason of age and satiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. I hope not.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Things which you don't hope happen more frequently than things which
      you do hope. In fine, if you cannot be persuaded by words to believe this
      to be the truth, judge of my words from facts; consider <i>this</i>
      instance, who I <i>now</i> am, and who I <i>once</i> was. No less than you
      <i>are</i> now, was I <i>once</i> beloved, and I devoted myself to one,
      who, faith, when with age this head changed its hue, forsook and deserted
      me. Depend on it, the same will happen to yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). I can scarcely withhold myself from flying at the
      eyes of this mischief-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. I am of opinion that I ought to keep myself alone devoted to him,
      since to myself alone has he given freedom for himself alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). O ye immortal Gods! what a charming woman, and of a
      disposition how chaste! By heaven, 'tis excellently done, and I'm rejoiced
      at it, that it is for her sake I've got nothing <i>left</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. On my word you really are silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. For what reason?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Because you care for this, whether he loves you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Prithee, why should I not care for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. You now are free. You've now got what you wanted; if he didn't still
      love you, as much money as he gave for your liberty, he'd lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). Heavens, I'm a dead man if I don't torture her to
      death after the most shocking fashion. That evil-persuading enticer to
      vice is corrupting this damsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Scapha, I can never return him <i>sufficient</i> thanks for what he
      deserves of me; don't you be persuading me to esteem him less.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. But take care and reflect upon this one thing, if you devote yourself
      to him alone, while now you are at this youthful age, you'll be
      complaining to no purpose in your aged years.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). I could wish myself this instant changed into a
      quinsy, that I might seize the throat of that old witch, and put an end to
      the wicked mischief-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. It befits me now to have the same grateful feelings since I
      obtained it, as formerly before I acquired it, when I used to lavish
      caresses upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). May the Gods do towards me what they please, if for
      that speech I don't make you free over again, and if I don't torture
      Scapha to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. If you are quite assured that you will have a provision to the end,
      and that this lover will be your own for life, I think that you ought to
      devote yourself to him alone, and assume the character of a wife {2}.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Just as a person's character is, he's in the habit of finding means
      accordingly; if I keep a good character for myself I shall be rich enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). By my troth, since selling there must be, my father
      shall be sold much sooner than, while I'm alive, I'll ever permit you to
      be in want or go a-begging.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. What's to become of the rest of those who are in love with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. They'll love me the more when they see me displaying gratitude to
      one who has done me services.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). I do wish that news were brought me now that my
      father's dead, that I might disinherit myself of my property, and that she
      might be my heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. This property <i>of his</i> will certainly soon be at an end; day and
      night there's eating <i>and</i> drinking, and no one displays thriftiness;
      'tis downright cramming {3}.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). I' faith, I'm determined to make trial on yourself
      for the first to be thrifty; for you shall neither eat nor drink anything
      at my house for the next ten days.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. If you choose to say anything good about him, you shall be at
      liberty to say it; if you speak otherwise than well, on my word you shall
      have a beating instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). Upon my faith, if I had paid sacrifice to supreme
      Jove with that money which I gave for her liberty, never could I have so
      well employed it. Do see, how, from her very heart's core, she loves me!
      Oh, I'm a fortunate man; I've liberated <i>in her</i> a patron to plead my
      cause for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I see that, compared with Philolaches, you disregard <i>all</i> other
      men; now, that on his account I mayn't get a beating, I'll agree with you
      in preference, if you are quite satisfied that he will always prove a
      friend to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Give me the mirror {4}, and the casket with my trinkets, directly,
      Scapha, that I may be <i>quite</i> dressed when Philolaches, my delight,
      comes here.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. A woman who neglects herself and her <i>youthful</i> age has occasion
      for a mirror; what need of a mirror have you, who yourself are in especial
      a mirror for a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). For that expression, Scapha, that you mayn't have
      said anything so pretty in vain, I'll to-day give something for your
      savings&mdash;to you, my Philematium.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. (<i>while</i> SCAPHA <i>is dressing her hair</i>). Will you see
      that each hair is nicely arranged in its own place?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. When you <i>yourself</i> are <i>so</i> nice, do believe that your
      hair must be nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). Out upon it! what worse thing can possibly be
      spoken of than this woman? Now the jade's a flatterer, just now she was
      all contradictory.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Hand me the ceruse {5}.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Why, what need of ceruse <i>have you</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. To paint my cheeks with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. On the same principle, you would want to be making ivory white with
      ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). Cleverly said that, about the ink and the ivory!
      Bravo! I applaud you, Scapha.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Well then, do you give me the rouge.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I shan't give it. You really are a clever one. Do you wish to patch
      up a most clever piece with new daubing? It's not right that any paint
      should touch that person, neither ceruse, nor quince-ointment, nor any
      other wash. Take the mirror, then. (<i>Hands her the glass.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart.</i>) Ah wretched me!&mdash;she gave the glass a kiss. I
      could much wish for a stone, with which to break the head of that glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Take the towel and wipe your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Why so, prithee?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. As you've been holding the mirror, I'm afraid that your hands may
      smell of silver; lest Philolaches should suspect you've been receiving
      silver somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). I don't think that I ever did see anyone procuress
      more cunning. How cleverly and artfully did it occur to the jade's
      imagination about the mirror!
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Do you think I ought to be perfumed with unguents as well?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. By no means do so. PHILE. For what reason?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. Because, i' faith, a woman smells best {6} when she smells of nothing
      at all. For those old women who are in the habit of anointing themselves
      with unguents, vampt up <i>creatures</i>, old hags, <i>and</i> toothless,
      who hide the blemishes of the person with paint, when the sweat has
      blended itself with the unguents, forthwith they stink just like when a
      cook has poured together a variety of broths; what they smell of, you
      don't know, except this only, that you understand that badly they do
      smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). How very cleverly she does understand everything!
      There's nothing more knowing than this knowing woman! (<i>To the</i>
      AUDIENCE.) This is the truth, and a very great portion, in fact, of you
      know it, who have old women for wives at home who purchased you with their
      portions.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Come now; examine my golden trinkets and my mantle; does this quite
      become me, Scapha?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. It befits not me to concern myself about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Whom then, prithee?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCA. I'll tell you; Philolaches; so that he may not buy anything except
      that which he fancies will please you. For a lover buys the favours of a
      mistress for himself with gold and purple garments. What need is there for
      that which he doesn't want as his own, to be shown him still? Age is to be
      enveloped in purple; gold ornaments are unsuitable for a woman. A
      beautiful woman will be more beautiful naked than drest in purple.
      Besides, it's in vain she's well-drest if she's ill-conducted; ill-conduct
      soils fine ornaments worse than dirt. But if she's beauteous, she's
      sufficiently adorned.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>apart</i>). Too long have I withheld my hand. (<i>Coming
      forward.</i>) What are you about here?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. I'm decking myself out to please you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. You are dressed enough. (<i>To</i> SCAPHA.) Go you hence indoors,
      and take away this finery. (SCAPHA <i>goes into the house.</i>) But, my
      delight, my Philematium, I have a mind to regale together with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. And, i' faith, so I have with you; for what you have a mind to, the
      same have I a mind to, my delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Ha! at twenty minae that expression were cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Give me ten, there's a dear; I wish to let you have that expression
      bought a bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. You've already got ten minae with you; or reckon up the account:
      thirty minae I gave for your freedom&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Why reproach me <i>with that</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. What, I reproach you with it? Why, I had rather that I myself were
      reproached with it; no money whatever for this long time have I ever laid
      out equally well.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. Surely, in loving you, I never could have better employed my pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. The account, then, of receipts and expenditure fully tallies
      between ourselves; you love me, I love you. Each thinks that it is so
      deservedly. Those who rejoice at this, may they ever rejoice at the
      continuance of their own happiness. Those who envy, let not any one
      henceforth be ever envious of their blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILE. (<i>pointing to a couch on the stage</i>). Come, take your place,
      then. (<i>At the door, to a</i> SERVANT, <i>who obeys.</i>) Boy, bring
      some water for the hands; put a little table here. See where are the dice.
      Would you like some perfumes? (<i>They recline on the couch.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. What need is there? Along with myrrh I am reclining. But isn't this
      my friend who's coming hither with his mistress? 'Tis he; it's
      Callidamates; look, he's coming. Capital! my sweet one, see, our comrades
      are approaching; they're coming to share the spoil.

      body.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Assume the character of a wife</i>)&mdash;Ver. 220.
      "Capiundos crines." Literally, "the hair mast be assumed." Festus says
      that it was usual on the occasion of the marriage ceremony, to add six
      rows of curls to the hair of the bride, in imitation of the Vestal
      virgins, who were patterns of purity, and were dressed in that manner.
      Hence the term "capere crines" came to signify "to become a wife."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>'Tis downright cramming</i>)&mdash;Ver. 230. "Sagina plane
      est." "Sagina" was the term applied to the fattening or cramming of
      animals for the purpose of killing. The use of the term implies Scapha'a
      notion of the bestial kind of life that Philolaches was leading.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>Give me the mirror</i>)&mdash;Ver. 242. Probably a mirror
      with a handle, such as the servants usually held for their mistresses.
      There is something comical in the notion of a female coming out into the
      street to make her toilet.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>Hand me the ceruse</i>)&mdash;Ver. 252. White lead, or
      "cerussa," was used by the Roman women for the purpose of whitening the
      complexion. Ovid mentions it in his Treatise on the Care of the
      Complexion, L 73.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>A woman smells best</i>)&mdash;Ver. 267. Cicero and

      is seeking for me and Philolaches, my master's son, to be undone. Our
      hopes are destroyed; nowhere is there any hold for courage; not <i>even</i>
      Salvation {1} <i>now</i> could save us if she wished. Such an immense
      mountain of woe have I just now seen at the harbour: my master has arrived
      from abroad; Tranio is undone! (<i>To the</i> AUDIENCE.) Is there any
      person who'd like to make gain of a little money, who could this day
      endure to take my place in being tortured? Where are those fellows
      hardened to a flogging, the wearers-out of iron chains, or those, who, for
      the consideration of three didrachms, would get beneath besieging towers
      {2}, where some are in the way of having their bodies pierced with fifteen
      spears? I'll give a talent to that man who shall be the first to run to
      the cross <i>for me</i>; but on condition that twice his feet, twice his
      arms {3} are fastened there. When that shall have been done, then ask the
      money down of me. But am I not a wretched fellow, not at full speed to be
      running home?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Here come the provisions; see, here's Tranio; he's come back from
      the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>running</i>). Philolaches!
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. What's the matter? TRA. Both I and you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. What about "Both I and you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Are undone!
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Why so? TRA. Your father's here.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. What is it I hear of you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. We are finished up. Your father's come, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>starting up.</i>) Where is he, I do entreat you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. He's coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Coming? Who says so? Who has seen him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I saw him myself, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Woe unto me! what am I about?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why the plague now do you ask me, what you are about? Taking your
      place at table, <i>of course</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Did you see him? TRA. I my own self, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. For certain? TRA. For certain, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. I'm undone, if you are telling the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What good could it be to me if I told a lie?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. What shall I do now?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>pointing to the table and couches</i>). Order all these things to
      be removed from here. (<i>Pointing.</i>) Who's that asleep there?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Callidamates. TRA. Arouse him, Delphium.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEL. (<i>bawling out in his ear</i>). Callidamates! Callidamates! awake!
      CALL. (<i>raising himself a little</i>). I am awake; give me something to
      drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEL. Awake; the father of Philolaches has arrived from abroad. CALL. I <i>hope</i>
      his father's well.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. He is well indeed; but I am utterly undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. You, utterly undone? How can that be?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. By heavens! do get up, I beg of you; my father has arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Your father has come? Bid him go back again. What business had he to
      come back here so soon?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. What am I to do? My father will, just now, be coming and
      unfortunately finding me amid drunken carousals, <i>and</i> the house full
      of revellers and women. It's a shocking bad job, to be digging a well at
      the last moment, just when thirst has gained possession of your throat;
      just as I, on the arrival of my father, wretch that I am, am now enquiring
      what I am to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>pointing at</i> CALLIDAMATES). Why look, he has laid down his
      head and gone to sleep. Do arouse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>shaking him</i>). Will you awake now? My father, I tell you,
      will be here this instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. How say you? Your father? Give me my shoes, that I may take up arms.
      On my word, I'll kill your father this instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. (<i>seizing hold of him</i>). You're spoiling the <i>whole</i>
      business; do hold your tongue. (<i>To</i> DELPHIUM.) Prithee, do carry him
      off in your arms into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. (<i>To</i> DELPHIUM, <i>who is lifting him up</i>). Upon my faith,
      I'll be making an utensil of you just now, if you don't find me one. (<i>He
      is led off into the house.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. I'm undone!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Be of good courage; I'll cleverly find a remedy for this alarm.
      PHILO. I'm utterly ruined!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Do hold your tongue; I'll think of something by means of which to
      alleviate this for you. Are you satisfied, if on his arrival I shall so
      manage your father, not only that he shall not enter, but even that he
      shall run away to a distance from the house? Do you only be off from here
      in-doors, and remove these things from here with all haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Where am I to be? TRA. Where you especially desire: with her (<i>pointing
      to</i> PHILEMATIUM); with this girl, <i>too</i>, you'll be. (<i>Pointing
      to</i> DELPHIUM.)
    </p>
    <p>
      DEL. How then? Are we to go away from here?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Not far from here, Delphium. For carouse away in the house not a bit
      the less on account of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Ah me! I'm in a sweat with fear as to how these fine words are to
      end! TRA. Can you not be tranquil in your mind, and do as I bid you?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. I can be. TRA. In the first place of all, Philematium, do you go
      in-doors; and you, Delphium.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEL. We'll both be obedient to you. (<i>They go into the house.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. May Jupiter grant it so! Now then, do you give attention as to what
      I'd have attended to. In the first place, then, before anything, cause the
      house to be shut up at once. Take care and don't let any one whisper a
      word in-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Care shall be taken. TRA. Just as though no living being were
      dwelling within the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Very well. TRA. And let no one answer, when the old gentleman
      knocks at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. Anything else?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Order the master-key {4} of the house to be brought me at once from
      within; this house I'll lock here on the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHILO. To your charge I commit myself, Tranio, and my hopes. (<i>He goes
      into the house, and the things are removed from the stage.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>to himself</i>). It matters not a feather whether a patron or a
      dependant is the nearest at hand for that man who has got no courage in
      his breast. For to every man, whether very good or very bad, even at a
      moment's notice, it is easy to act with craft; but this must be looked to,
      this is the duty of a prudent man, that what has been planned and done in
      craftiness, may all come about smoothly and without mishap; so that he may
      not have to put up with anything by reason of which he might be loth to
      live; just as I shall manage, that, from the confusion which we shall here
      create, all shall really go on smoothly and tranquilly, and not produce us
      any inconvenience in the results. (<i>Enter a</i> BOY, <i>from the house.</i>)
      But, why have you come out? I'm undone! (<i>The</i> BOY <i>shows him the
      key.</i>) O very well, you've obeyed my orders most opportunely.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOY. He bade me most earnestly to entreat you some way or other to scare
      away his father, that he may not enter the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Even more, tell him this, that I'll cause that he shan't venture even
      to look at the house, <i>and</i> to take to flight, covering up his head
      {5} with the greatest alarm. Give me the key (<i>taking it</i>), and be
      off in-doors, and shut to the door, and I'll lock it on this side. (<i>The</i>
      BOY <i>goes into the house, and</i> TRANIO <i>locks the door.</i>) Bid him
      now come forthwith. For the old gentleman here while still alive this day
      will I institute games {6} in his presence, such as I fancy there will
      never be for him when he's dead. (<i>Moving away.</i>) I'll go away from
      the door to this spot; hence, I'll look out afar in which direction to lay
      the burden on the old fellow on his arrival. (<i>Exit to a little
      distance.</i>)

      outside, but not from within. According to some, this key was called
      "Laconica," from its rough appearance, in allusion to the inelegant

    <h3>
      <i>Enter</i> THEUROPIDES, <i>followed by</i> ATTENDANTS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to himself</i>). Neptune, I do return extreme thanks to thee
      that thou hast just dismissed me from thee, <i>though</i> scarce alive.
      But if, from this time forward, thou shalt only know that I have stirred a
      foot upon the main, there is no reason why, that instant, thou shouldst
      not do with me that which thou hast now wished to do. Away with you, away
      with you from me henceforth for ever after to-day; what I was to entrust
      to thee, all of it have I <i>now</i> entrusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter</i> TRANIO, <i>overhearing him.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>apart</i>). By my troth, Neptune, you've been much to blame, to
      have lost this opportunity so fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. After three years, I've arrived home from Aegypt. I shall come a
      welcome <i>guest</i> to my household, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>apart</i>). Upon my faith, he might have come a much more welcome
      one, who had brought the tidings you were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>looking at the door</i>). But what means this? Is the door shut
      in the daytime? I'll knock. (<i>Knocks at the door.</i>) Hallo, there! is
      any one going to open this door for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>coming forward, and speaking aloud</i>). What person is it that
      has come <i>so</i> near to our house?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Surely this is my servant Tranio.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. O Theuropides, my master, welcome; I'm glad that you've arrived in
      safety. Have you been well all along?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. All along, as you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. That's very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What about yourselves? Are you <i>all</i> mad?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. For this reason; because you are walking about outside; not a born
      person is keeping watch in the house, either to open or to give an answer.
      With kicking with my feet I've almost broken in the panels?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. How now? Have you been touching this house?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Why shouldn't I touch it? Why, with kicking it, I tell you, I've
      almost broken down the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What, you touched it?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I touched it, I tell you, and knocked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Out upon you! THEU. Why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. By heavens! 'twas ill done.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What is the matter? TRA. It cannot be expressed, how shocking and
      dreadful a mischief you've been guilty of.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. How so?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Take to flight, I beseech you, and get away from the house. Fly in
      this direction, fly closer to me. (<i>He runs towards</i> TRANIO.) What,
      did you touch the door?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. How could I knock, if I didn't touch it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. By all that's holy, you've been the death&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Of what person? TRA. Of all your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. May the Gods and Goddesses confound you with that omen.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I'm afraid that you can't make satisfaction for yourself and them.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. For what reason, or what new affair is this that you <i>thus</i>
      suddenly bring me <i>news of</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. And (<i>whispering</i>) hark you, prithee, do bid those people to
      move away from here. (<i>Pointing to the</i> ATTENDANTS <i>of</i>
      THEUROPIDES.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to the</i> ATTENDANTS). More away from here.

      as well. (<i>Exeunt the</i> ATTENDANTS.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I' faith, prithee, do speak out now.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Because it is now seven months that not a person has set foot within
      this house, <i>and</i> since we once for all left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Tell me, why so?

    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>looking around</i>). There's nobody; now then, speak out. TRA. (<i>in
      a loud whisper</i>). The house has been guilty of a capital offence {2}.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I don't understand <i>you</i>. TRA. A crime, tell you, has been
      committed <i>there</i>, a long while ago, one of olden time and ancient
      date.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Of ancient date?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. 'Tis but recently, in fact, that we've discovered this deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What is this crime, or who committed it? Tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. A host slew his guest, seized with his hand: he, I fancy, who sold
      you the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Slew <i>him</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. And robbed this guest of his gold, and buried this guest there in the
      house, on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. For what reason do you suspect that this took place?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I'll tell <i>you</i>; listen. <i>One day</i>, when your son had dined
      away from home, after he returned home from dining; we all went to bed, <i>and</i>
      fell asleep. By accident, I had forgotten to put out my lamp; and he, all
      of a sudden, called out aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What person? My son?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Hist! hold your peace: just listen. He said that a dead man came to
      him in his sleep&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. In his dreams, then, you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Just so. But only listen. He said that he had met with his death by
      these means&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. <i>What</i>, in his sleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. It would have been surprising if he had told him awake, who had been
      murdered sixty years ago. On some occasions you are absurdly simple. But
      look what he said: "I am the guest of Diapontius, from beyond the seas;
      here do I dwell; this has been assigned me as my abode; for Oreus would
      not receive me in Acheron, because prematurely I lost my life. Through
      confiding was I deceived: my entertainer slew me here, and that villain
      secretly laid me in the ground without funereal rites, in this house, on
      the spot, for the sake of gold. Now do you depart from here; this house is
      accursed, <i>this</i> dwelling is defiled." The wonders that here take
      place, hardly in a year could I recount them. Hush, hush! (<i>He starts.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Troth now, what has happened, prithee?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. The door made a noise. Was it he that was knocking?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>turning pale</i>). I have not <i>one</i> drop of blood! Dead men
      are come to fetch me to Acheron, while alive!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside</i>). I'm undone! those people there will mar my plot. (<i>A
      noise is heard from within.</i>) How much I dread, lest he should catch me
      in the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What are you talking about to yourself? (<i>Goes near the door.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Do get away from the door. By heavens, fly, I do beseech you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Fly where? Fly yourself, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I am not afraid: I am at peace with the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      A VOICE (<i>from within</i>). Hallo! Tranio {3}.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>in a low voice, near the door</i>). You won't be calling me, if
      you are wise. (<i>Aloud, as if speaking to the</i> APPARITION.) 'Tis not I
      that's guilty; I did not knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Pray, what is it that's wrong? What matter is agitating you, Tranio?
      To whom are you saying these things?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Prithee, was it you that called me? So may the Gods bless me, I
      fancied it was this dead man expostulating because you had knocked at the
      door. But are you still standing there, and not doing what I advise you?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What am I to do? TRA. Take care not to look back. Fly; cover up your
      head!
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Why don't you fly?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I am at peace with the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I recollect. Why then were you so dreadfully alarmed just now?
    </p>
    <p>
      TREA. Have no care for me, I tell you; I'll see to myself. You, as you
      have begun <i>to do</i>, fly as quick as ever you can; Hercules, too {4},
      you will invoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Hercules, I do invoke thee! (<i>Runs off.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>to himself.</i>) And I, as well, old fellow, that this day he'll
      send some heavy mishap upon you. O ye immortal Gods, I do implore your
      aid. Plague on it! what a mess I have got into to-day. (<i>Exit.</i>

      ACT III.&mdash;SCENE I.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <i>Enter a</i> BANKER, <i>at the end of the stage.</i>
    </h3>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>to himself</i>). I never knew any year worse for money upon
      interest, than this year has turned out to me. From morning even until
      night, I spend my time in the Forum; I cannot lend out a coin of silver to
      any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter</i> TRANIO.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>apart</i>). Now, faith, I am clearly undone in an everlasting
      way! The Banker's here who found the money with which his mistress was
      bought. The matter's all out, unless I meet him a bit beforehand, so that
      the old man may not at present come to know of this. I'll go meet him. But
      (<i>seeing</i> THEUROPIDES) I wonder why he has so soon betaken himself
      homeward <i>again</i>. I'm afraid that he has heard something about this
      affair. I'll meet him, and accost him. But how dreadfully frightened I am!
      Nothing is more wretched than the mind of a man with a <i>guilty</i>
      conscience, such as possesses myself. But however this matter turns out,
      I'll proceed to perplex it still further: so does this affair require.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter</i> THEUROPIDES.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>accosting him</i>). Whence come you?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I met that person from whom I bought this house.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Did you tell him anything about that which I was telling you?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I' faith, I certainly told him everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside</i>). Woe to unfortunate me! I'm afraid that my schemes are
      everlastingly undone!
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What is it you are saying to yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why nothing. But tell me, prithee, did you <i>really</i> tell him?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I told him everything in its order, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Does he, then, confess about the guest?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Why no; he utterly denies it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Does he deny it?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Do you ask me again? I should tell you if he had confessed it. What
      now are you of opinion ought to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What is my opinion? By my troth, I beg of you, appoint an arbitrator
      together with him; but take you care that you appoint one who will believe
      me; you'll overcome him as easily as a fox eats a pear {1}
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>to himself</i>). But see, here's Tranio, the servant of
      Philolaches, <i>people</i> who pay me neither interest nor principal on my
      money. (<i>Goes towards</i> TRANIO, <i>who steps forward to meet him.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to</i> TRANIO). Whither are you betaking yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I'm going no whither. (<i>Aside.</i>) For sure, I am a wretch, a
      rascal, one born with all the Gods my foes! He'll now be accosting me in
      the old man's presence. Assuredly, I am a wretched man; in such a fashion
      both this way and that do they find business for me. But I'll make haste
      and accost him. (<i>Moves towards the</i> BANKER.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>apart</i>). He's coming towards me. I'm all right; I've some
      hopes of my money; he's smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>to himself</i>). The fellow's deceived. (<i>To the</i> BANKER.) I
      heartily bid you hail, my <i>friend</i> Saturides {2}.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. And hail to you. What about the money?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Be off with you, will you, you brute. Directly you come, you commence
      the attack {3} against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>apart</i>). This fellow's empty-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>overhearing him</i>). This fellow's surely a conjurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. But why don't you put an end to this trifling?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Tell me, then, what it is you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. Where is Philolaches?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. You never could have met me more opportunely than you have met me.
      BAN. How's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>taking him aside</i>). Step this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>aloud</i>). Why isn't the money repaid me?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I know that you have a good voice; don't bawl out so loud. BAN. (<i>aloud</i>).
      I' faith, I certainly shall bawl out.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. O, do humour me <i>now</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. What do you want me to humour you in?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Prithee, be off hence home.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. Be off? TRA. Return here about mid-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. Will the interest be paid then?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. It will be paid. Be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. Why should I run to and fro here, or use or waste my pains? What if I
      remain here until mid-day in preference?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why no; be off home. On my word, I'm telling the truth. Only do be
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>aloud</i>). Then do you pay me my interest. Why do you trifle <i>with
      me</i> this way?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Bravo! faith. Really now, do be off; do attend to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>aloud</i>). I' faith, I'll call him now by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Bravo! stoutly done! Really you are <i>quite</i> rich now when you
      bawl out.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>aloud</i>). I'm asking for my own. In this way you've been
      disappointing me for these many days past. If I'm troublesome, give me
      back the money; I'll go away <i>then</i>: That expression {4} puts an end
      to all replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>pretending to offer it him</i>). <i>Then</i>, take the principal
      {5}.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>aloud</i>). Why no, the interest; I want that first.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What? Have you, you fellow most foul of all fellows, come here to
      burst yourself? Do what lies in your power. He's not going to pay you; he
      doesn't owe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. Not owe it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Not a tittle, indeed, can you get from here. Would you prefer for him
      to go abroad, <i>and</i> leave the city in exile, driven hence for your
      sake? Why then, in preference let him pay the {6} principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. But I don't ask for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>calling out to</i> TRANIO, <i>from a distance</i>). Hark you!
      you whip-knave, come back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>to</i> THEUROPIDES). I'll be there just now. (<i>To the</i>
      BANKER.) Don't you be troublesome: no one's going to pay you; do what you
      please. You are the only person, I suppose, that lends money upon
      interest. (<i>Moves towards</i> THEUROPIDES.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>bawling aloud</i>). Give me my interest! pay me my interest! you
      pay my interest! Are you going to give me my interest this instant? Give
      me my interest!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Interest here, interest there! The old rogue knows how to talk about
      nothing but interest. I do not think that ever I saw any beast more vile
      than you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. Upon my faith, you don't alarm me now with those expressions. This is
      of a hot nature; although it is at a distance off, it scorches badly {7}.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Don't you be troublesome; no one's going to pay you; do what you
      please. You are the only person, I suppose, that lends money upon
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to</i> TRANIO). Pray, what interest is this that he is asking
      for?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>in a low voice, to the</i> BANKER). Look now; his father has
      arrived from abroad, not long since; he'll pay you both, interest and
      principal; don't you then attempt any further to make us your enemies. See
      whether he puts you off.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. Nay but, I'll take it, if anything's offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to</i> TRANIO, <i>coming towards him</i>). What do you say, <i>then</i>&mdash;?
      TRA. What is it you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Who is this? What is he asking for? Why is he thus rudely speaking
      of my son Philolaches in this way, and giving you abuse to your face?
      What's owing him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>to</i> THEUROPIDES). I beg of you, do order the money to be
      thrown in the face of this dirty brute.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I, order it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Order the fellow's face to be pelted with money.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>coming nearer</i>). I could very well put up with a pelting with
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to</i> TRANIO). What money's this?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Philolaches owes this person a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. How much?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. About forty minae.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>to</i> THEUROPIDES). Really, don't think much of that; it's a
      trifle, in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Don't you hear him? Troth now, prithee, doesn't he seem just suited
      to be a Banker&mdash;a generation that's most roguish?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I don't care, just now, for that, who he is <i>or</i> whence he is;
      this I want to be told me, this I very much wish to know&mdash;I heard
      from him that there was interest owing on the money as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Forty-four minae are due to him. Say that you'll pay it, that he may
      be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I, say that I'll pay it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Do say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What, I?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. You yourself. Do only say so. Do be guided by me. Do promise. Come
      now, I say; I beg of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Answer me; what has been done with this money?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. It's safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Pay it yourselves then, if it's safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Your son has bought a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. A house?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. A house.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Bravo! Philolaches is taking after his father! The fellow now turns
      to merchandize. A house, say you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. A house, I tell you. But do you know of what sort?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. How can I know?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Out with you!
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Don't ask me <i>that</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. But why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Bright as a mirror, pure brilliancy <i>itself</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Excellently done, upon my faith! Well, how much did he agree to give
      for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. As many great talents as you and I <i>put together</i> make; but
      these forty minae he paid by way of earnest. (<i>Pointing to the</i>
      BANKER.) From him he received what we paid the other man. Do you quite
      understand? {8} For after this house was in such a state as I mentioned to
      you, he at once purchased another house for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Excellently done, upon my faith!
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. (<i>touching</i> TRANIO). Hark <i>you</i>. Mid-day is now close at
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Prithee, do dismiss this puking fellow, that he mayn't worry us to
      death. Forty-four minae are due to him, both principal and interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. 'Tis just that much; I ask for nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Upon my faith, I really could have wished that you had asked more, <i>if
      only</i> by a single coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to the</i> BANKER). Young man, transact the business with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. I'm to ask it of you, you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Come for it to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAN. I'll be off, <i>then</i>; I'm quite satisfied if I get it tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exit</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside</i>). A plague may all the Gods and Goddesses send upon
      him! so utterly has he disarranged my plans. On my word, no class of men
      is there more disgusting, or less <i>acquainted</i> with fair dealing than
      the banking <i>race</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. In what neighbourhood did my son buy this house?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside</i>). Just see that, now! I'm undone!
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Are you going to tell me that which I ask you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I'll tell you; but I'm thinking what was the name of the owner. (<i>Pretends
      to think.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Well, call it to mind, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside</i>). What am I to do now, except <i>put</i> the lie upon
      this neighbour of ours next door? I'll say that his son has bought that
      house. I' faith, I've heard say that a lie piping-hot is the best <i>lie</i>;
      this is piping-hot; although it is at a distance off, it scorches badly.
      Whatever the Gods dictate, that am I determined to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Well now? Have you recollected it by this?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside</i>). May the Gods confound that fellow!&mdash;no, this <i>other</i>
      fellow, rather. (<i>To</i> THEUROPIDES.) Your son has bought the house of
      this next-door neighbour <i>of yours</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. In real truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. If, indeed, you are going to pay down the money, then in real <i>truth</i>;
      if you are not going to pay it, in real truth he has not bought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. He hasn't bought it in a very good situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why yes, in a very good one.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I' faith, I should like to look over this house; just knock at the
      door, and call some one to you from within, Tranio.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside</i>). Why just look now, again I don't know what I'm to
      say. Once more, now, are the surges bearing me upon the self-same rock.
      What now? I' faith, I can't discover what I am now to do; I'm caught in
      the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Just call some one out of doors; ask him to show us round.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>going to the door of</i> SIMO's <i>house</i>). Hallo there, you!
      (<i>Turning round</i>.) But there are ladies here; we must first see
      whether they are willing or unwilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. You say what's good and proper; just make enquiry, and ask. I'll
      wait here outside until you come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside</i>). May all the Gods and Goddesses utterly confound you,
      old gentleman! in such a fashion are you thwarting my artful plans in
      every way. Bravo! very good! Look, Simo himself, the owner of the house,
      is coming out of doors. I'll step aside here, until I have convened the
      senate of council in my mind. Then, when I've discovered what I am to do,
      I'll join him. (THEUROPIDES <i>and</i> TRANIO <i>stand at a distance from</i>
      SIMO's <i>house, in opposite directions</i>, THEUROPIDES <i>being out of
      sight</i>.)

      eat a pear; but if does, his teeth will go through it with the greatest
      ease. Not improbably, Tranio uses the expression for its ambiguity.}

      the author, from "satur," "brimful," of money, probably.}

      {Footnote 3: <i>Commence the attack</i>)&mdash;Ver. 564. "Pilum
      injecisti." Literally, "you have thrown the dart." "To throw the dart" was
      a common expression, signifying to make the first attack;" as the darts
      were thrown before recourse was had to the sword.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>That expression</i>)&mdash;Ver. 574. By "hoc verbum" he
      probably alludes to the expression, "reddite argentum," "down with the
      money."}

      {Footnote 5: <i>Take the principal</i>)&mdash;Ver. 575. He finds he must
      say something, so he says this, although he has no money with him. He
      knows, however, that the usurer will first insist on the interest being
      paid, because if he takes the principal, it will be a legal waver of his
      right to claim the interest.}

      hopelessly incorrect.}

    <p>
      {Footnote 7: <i>It scorches badly</i>)&mdash;Ver. 592. This line is given
      by Gruter to Theuropides, by Acidalius to Tranio, and by Lambinus to the
      Banker. The latter seems the most appropriate owner of it; and he probably
      alludes, aside, to the effects of his pressing in a loud voice for the
      money. Tranio is introduced as using the same expression, in l.650; but
      there can be no doubt that the line, as there inserted, is spurious.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 8: <i>Do you quite understand</i>)&mdash;Ver. 629. Warner
      suggests, that by using this expression before the Banker, he intends to
      make a secret of the house being haunted, and that he keeps up the mystery
      in the succeeding line.}

      SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Enter</i> SIMO, <i>from his house</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SIM. (<i>to himself</i>). I've not enjoyed myself better at home this year
      <i>than I have to-day</i>, nor has at any time any meal pleased me better.
      My wife provided a very nice breakfast for me; now she bids me go take a
      nap. By no means! It instantly struck me that <i>it didn't so happen</i>
      by chance. She provided a better breakfast than is her wont; <i>and then</i>,
      the old lady wanted to draw me away to my chamber. Sleep is not good {1}
      after breakfast&mdash;out upon it! I secretly stole away from the house,
      out of doors. My wife, I'm sure, is now quite bursting <i>with rage</i> at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>apart</i>). A sore mischance is provided for this old fellow by
      the evening; for he must both dine and go to bed in-doors in sorry
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. (<i>continuing</i>). The more I reflect upon it in my mind: if any
      person has a dowried <i>wife</i>, sleep has no charms for him. I detest
      going to take a nap. It's a settled matter with me to be off to the Forum
      from here, rather than nap it at home. And, i' faith (<i>to the</i>
      AUDIENCE), I don't know how your <i>wives</i> are in their behaviour; this
      <i>wife of mine</i>, I know right well how badly she treats me, <i>and</i>
      that she will prove more annoying to me hereafter than she has been.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>apart</i>). If your escape, old gentleman, turns out amiss,
      there'll be no reason for you to be accusing any one of the Gods; by very
      good right, you may justly lay the blame upon yourself. It's time now for
      me to accost this old fellow. 'Tis down upon him. {2} I've hit upon a plan
      whereby to cajole the old fellow, by means of which to drive grief {3}
      away from me. I'll accost him. (<i>Accosting him</i>.) May the Gods, Simo,
      send on you many blessings! (<i>Takes him by the hand</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Save you, Tranio! TRA. How fare you?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Not amiss. What are you about?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Holding <i>by the hand</i> a very worthy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. You act in a friendly way, in speaking well of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. It certainly is your due.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. But, i' faith, in you I don't hold a good servant <i>by the hand</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>calling from a distance, where he is not perceived by</i> SIMO).
      Hark you! you whip-knave, come back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>turning round</i>). I'll be there just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Well now, how soon&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What is it? SIM. The usual goings-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Tell me then, these usual goings-on, what are they?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. The way that you <i>yourselves</i> proceed. But, Tranio, to say the
      truth, according as men are, it so befits you to humour them; reflecting,
      at the same time, how short life is.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What <i>of all this</i>? Dear me, at last, after some difficulty,
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceive that you are talking about these goings-on of ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. I' faith, you <i>people</i> are living a merry life, just as befits
      you: on wine, good cheer, nice dainty fish, you enjoy life.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why yes, so it was in time past, indeed; <i>but</i> now these things
      have come to an end all at once. SIM. How so?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. So utterly, Simo, are we all undone!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Won't you hold your tongue? Everything has gone on prosperously with
      you hitherto.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEA. I don't deny that it has been as you say; undoubtedly, we have lived
      heartily, just as we pleased; but, Simo, in such a way has the breeze now
      forsaken our ship&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. What's the matter? In what way?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. In a most shocking <i>way</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. What, wasn't it hauled ashore {4} in safety?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Ah me! SIM. What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Ah wretched me! I'm utterly undone!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. How so? TRA. Because a ship has come, to smash the hull of our ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. I would wish as you would wish, Tranio, <i>for your own sake</i>. But
      what is the matter? Do inform me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I will inform you. My master has arrived from abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. In that case, the cord will be stretched for you; thence to the place
      where iron fetters clink; after that, straight to the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Now, by your knees, I do implore you, don't give information to my
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Don't you fear; he shall know nothing from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Blessings on you, my patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. I don't care for clients of this description for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Now as to this about which our old gentleman has sent me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. First answer me this that I ask you. As yet, has your old gentleman
      discovered anything of these matters?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Nothing whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Has he censured his son at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. He is as calm as the calm weather is wont to be. Now he has requested
      me most earnestly to beg this of you, that leave may be given him to see
      over this house of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. It's not for sale. TRA. I know that indeed; but the old gentleman
      wishes to build a woman's apartment {5} here in his own house, baths, too,
      and a piazza, and a porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. What has he been dreaming of?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I'll tell you. He wishes to give his son a wife as soon as he can;
      for that purpose he wants a new apartment for the women. But he says that
      some builder, I don't know who, has been praising up to him this <i>house
      of yours</i>, as being remarkably well built; now he's desirous to take a
      model from it, if you don't make any objection&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Indeed, he is really choosing a plan for himself from a piece of poor
      workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. <i>It was</i> because he heard that here the summer heat was much
      modified; that this house was wont to be inhabited each day all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Why really, upon my faith, on the contrary, while there's shade in
      every direction, in spite of it, the sun is always here from morning till
      night: he stands, like a dun, continually at the door; and I have no shade
      anywhere, unless, perhaps, there may be some in the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Well now, have you one from Sarsina, if you have no woman of Umbria
      {6}?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Don't be impertinent. It is just as I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Still, he wishes to look over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. He may look over it, if he likes. If there is anything that takes his
      fancy, let him build after my plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Am I to go and call <i>this</i> person hither?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Go <i>and</i> call him.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>to himself, as he goes to the other side of the stage to call</i>
      THEUROPIDES). They say that Alexander the Great and Agathocles {7}
      achieved two very great exploits; what shall be the lot of myself, a
      third, who, unaided, am achieving deeds imperishable? This old fellow is
      carrying his pack-saddle, the other one, as well. I've hit upon a novel
      trade for myself, not a bad one; whereas muleteers have mules to carry
      pack-saddles; I've got men to carry the pack-saddles. They are able to
      carry heavy burdens; whatever you put upon them, they carry. Now, I don't
      know whether I am to address him. I'll accost him, <i>however</i>. (<i>Calling
      aloud.</i>) Hark you, Theuropides!
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>coming forward</i>). Well; who's calling me?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. A servant most attached to his master. Where you sent me, I got it
      all agreed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Prithee, why did you stay there so long?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. The old gentleman hadn't leisure; I was waiting until then.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. You keep up that old way of yours, of being tardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Hark you! if you please reflect upon this proverb: to blow and
      swallow {8} at the same moment isn't easy to be done; I couldn't be here
      and there at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What now?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Come and look, and inspect it at your own pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Very well, you go before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Am I delaying <i>to do so?</i> THEU. I'll follow after you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEA. (<i>as they advance</i>). Look, the old gentleman himself is awaiting
      you before the door, but he is concerned that he has sold this <i>house</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. He begs me to persuade Philolaches to let him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I don't think <i>he will</i>. Each man reaps on his own farm {9}. If
      it had been bought dear, we shouldn't have had permission to return it on
      his hands. Whatever profit there is, it's proper to bring it home. It
      don't, now-a-days, befit men to be showing compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I' faith, you are losing time while you are talking. Follow <i>me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Be it so. TRA. (<i>to</i> THEUROPIDES). I'll give you my services. (<i>Pointing.</i>)
      There's the old gentleman. (<i>To</i> SIMO.) Well now, I've brought you <i>this</i>
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. I'm glad that you've arrived safely from abroad, Theuropides. THEU.
      May the Gods bless you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Your servant was telling me that you were desirous to look over this
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Unless it's inconvenient to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Oh no; <i>quite</i> convenient. Do step in-doors and look over it.
      THEU. (<i>pausing</i>). But yet&mdash;the ladies&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Take you care not to trouble yourself a straw about any lady. Walk in
      every direction, wherever you like, all over the house, just as though it
      were your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>apart to</i> TRANIO). "Just as though&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>whispering</i>). Oh, take care that you don't throw it in his
      teeth now in his concern, that you have bought it. Don't you see him, how
      sad a countenance the old gentleman has?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>apart</i>). I see. TRA. (<i>apart</i>). Then don't seem to
      exult, and to be overmuch delighted; <i>in fact</i>, don't make mention
      that you've bought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>apart</i>). I understand; and I think you've given good advice,
      and that it shows a humane disposition. (<i>Turning to</i> SIMO.) What
      now?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Won't you go in? Look over it at your leisure, just as you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I consider that you are acting civilly and kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Troth, I wish to do so. Should you like some one to show you over.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Away with any one to show {10} me over. I don't want him. SIM. Why?
      What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I'll go wrong, rather than any one should show me over.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>pointing</i>). Don't you see, this vestibule before the house,
      and the piazza, of what a compass it is?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Troth, really handsome!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Well, look <i>now</i>, what pillars there are, with what strength
      they are built, and of what a thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I don't think that I <i>ever</i> saw handsomer pillars.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. I' faith, they were some time since bought by me at such a price!
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside, whispering</i>). Don't you hear&mdash;"They were <i>once"?</i>
      He seems hardly able to refrain from tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. At what price did you purchase them?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. I gave three minae for the two, besides the carriage. (<i>He retires
      to some distance.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>after looking close at them, to</i> TRANIO). Why, upon my word,
      they are much more unsound than I thought them at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why so? THEU. Because, i' faith, the woodworm has split them both
      from the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I think they were cut at an improper season; that fault damages them;
      but even as it is, they are quite good enough, if they are covered with
      pitch. But it was no foreign pulse-eating artisan {11} did this work.
      Don't you see the joints in the door? (<i>Pointing.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I see them. TRA. Look, how close together they are sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Sleeping? TRA. That is, how they wink, I intended to say. Are you
      satisfied?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. The more I look at each particular, the more it pleases me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>pointing</i>). Don't you see the painting, where one crow {12} is
      baffling two vultures? The crow stands there; it's pecking at them both in
      turn. This way, look, prithee, towards me {13}, that you may be able to
      see the crow. (THEUROPIDES <i>turns towards him.</i>) Now do you see it?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>looking about</i>). For my part, I really see no crow there.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. But do you look in that direction, towards yourselves, since you
      cannot discover the crow, if perchance you may be able to espy the
      vultures. (THEUROPIDES <i>turns towards</i> SIMO.) Now do you see <i>them</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Upon my faith, I don't see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. But I <i>can see</i> two vultures.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. To make an end of it with you, I don't see any bird at all painted
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Well then, I give it up. I excuse you; it is through age you cannot
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. These things which I can <i>see</i>, really they do all please me
      mightily.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. (<i>coming forward</i>). Now, at length, it's worth your while to
      move further on. THEU. Troth, you give good advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. (<i>calling at the door</i>). Ho there, boy! take <i>this person</i>
      round this house and the apartments. But I myself would have shown you
      round, if I hadn't had business at the Forum.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Away with any one to show me over. I don't want to be shown over.
      Whatever it is, I'd rather go wrong than any one should show me over.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. The house I'm speaking of.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Then I'll go in without any one to show me over.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Go, by all means.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I'll go in-doors, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>holding him back</i>). Stop, please; let me see whether the dog&mdash;THEU.
      Very well then, look. (TRANIO <i>looks into the passage.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. There is one. THEU. (<i>looking in</i>). Where is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>to the dog</i>). Be off and be hanged! 'St, won't you be off to
      utter perdition with you? What, do you still linger? 'St, away with you
      from here!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. (<i>coming nearer to the door</i>). There's no danger. You only move
      on. It's as gentle {14} as a woman in childbed. You may boldly step
      in-doors wherever you like. I'm going hence to the Forum.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. You've acted obligingly. Good speed to you! (<i>Exit</i> SIMO.)
      Tranio, come, make that dog move away from the door inside, although it
      isn't to be feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Nay but (<i>pointing</i>), you look at it, how gently it lies. Unless
      you'd like yourself to appear troublesome and cowardly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Very well, just as you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Follow me this way then.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. For my part, I shall not move in any direction from your feet. (<i>They
      go into the house</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Sleep is not good</i>)&mdash;Ver. 681. It was a custom
      with the Romans to take a nap at noon, after the "prandium." The modern
      Italians have the same practice, and call it the "siesta." Simo has his
      private reasons for thinking that this nap is not wholesome in his own
      case.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Down upon him)</i>&mdash;Ver. 698. "Hoc habet." Literally,
      "he has it;" a term used by the Spectators, when a gladiator received a
      wound at the gladiatoral games.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>By means of which to drive grief)</i>&mdash;Ver. 699. He
      plays upon the resemblance of the words "dolo" and "dolorem."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>Wasn't it hauled ashore</i>)&mdash;Vet. 723. It was the
      custom, when ships were not in use, especially in the winter time, to draw
      them up on chore, by means of rollers placed beneath them.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>A woman's apartment</i>)&mdash;Ver. 741. "Gynaeceum." This
      was a name borrowed from the Greeks, for the apartments in the house which
      were especially devoted to the use of the females.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>No woman of Umbria</i>)&mdash;Ver. 756. This is a poor pun
      upon the different acceptations of the word "umbra," which may signify,
      according to the context, "shade," or "a woman of Umbria." Simo means it
      in the former, while Tranio chooses to take it in the latter sense. Simo
      does not like this attempt at wit, and tells him not to be impertinent. We
      may here observe, that Plautus was born at Sarsina, a town of Umbria.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 7: <i>Agathocles</i>)&mdash;Ver. 761. Agathocles rose from the
      station of a potter to be king of Sicily.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 8: <i>To blow and swallow</i>)&mdash;Ver. 777. Or "exhale and
      inhale." A proverbial expression, very similar to that in use with us,
      that "a person cannot blow hot and cold at the same time."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 9: <i>Reaps on his own farm</i>)&mdash;Ver. 785. A country
      proverb, meaning "every one for himself."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 10: <i>Away with any one to show</i>)&mdash;Ver. 804. He says
      this, not liking the mention of the word "perductor," which, beside
      meaning an "attendant" or "one to escort," signifies a "pander" or
      "procurer." So in the next line, "perducto" means "to show over" or "to
      act the procurer."}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 11: <i> Foreign pulse-eating artisan</i>)&mdash;Ver. 817. From
      the use of the word "pultiphagus," he probably alludes to Carthaginian
      workmen, who were very skilful at working in wood. In the Poenulus, Hanno
      the Carthaginian is called "patruus pultiphagonides," "the pulse-eating
      kinsman." If this is the meaning, it is pretty clear that he is not
      speaking in praise of the workmanship. Some, however, think that as, in
      early times, the lower classes at Rome lived upon "puls," "pap" or
      "pottage," the Scene being at Athens, Roman workmen are alluded to; if so,
      he may mean to speak in praise of the work, and to say that no bungling
      artists made the doors. See the Note in p. 355. The joints are said to
      wink, from the close conjunction of the eyelids in the act of winking.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 12: <i>Where one crow</i>)&mdash;Ver. 821. By the "crow," he
      means himself; and by the "vultures," the two old men. Simo is probably
      standing at some distance off; and knowing that his master's sight is not
      good, he feels that he may deride him with impunity.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 13: <i>Towards me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 822. "Ad me." Theuropides
      thinks he means, "in my direction;" whereas Tranio really means, "look 'at
      me,' and you will see the crow;" though he does not intend that his master
      shall take it in that sense.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 14: <i>It's as gentle</i>)&mdash;Ver. 840. This, probably, is
      intended to refer to the statue of a dog lying down in the vestibule, and
      not a real one. Pictures of dogs, with "cave canem" written beneath, were
      sometimes painted on the wall near the door.}

      ACT IV.&mdash;SCENE I.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <i>Enter</i> PHANISCUS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      PHA. (<i>to himself</i>). Servants who, though they are free from fault,
      still stand in awe of punishment, those same are wont to be serviceable to
      their masters. But those who fear nothing, after they have merited
      punishment, hit upon foolish plans for themselves: they exercise
      themselves in running; they take to flight. But, if they are caught, they
      acquire from punishment a hoard, which by good means they cannot. They
      increase from a very little, <i>and</i> from that they lay by a treasure.
      The resolution that's in my mind is to be determined to be on my guard
      against punishment, before my back comes to lose its state of soundness.
      As hitherto it has been, so does it become my hide <i>still</i> to be,
      without a bruise, and such that I should decline its being beaten. If I
      have any control over it, I shall keep it well covered up {1}. When
      punishment is being showered down on others, don't let it be showered down
      on me. But as servants wish their master to be, such is he wont to be. He
      is good to the good, bad to the bad. But now at our house at home there do
      live so many rogues, lavish of their property {2}, bearers of stripes.
      When they are called to go fetch their master, "I shan't go; don't be
      plaguing <i>me</i>; I know where you are hurrying off to," <i>is the reply</i>.
      "Now, faith, you mule, you're longing to go to pasturage out of doors
      {3}." With better deserts, this advantage have I reaped from them, <i>and</i>,
      in consequence, I have come from home. I alone, out of <i>so</i> many
      servants, am going to fetch my master. When, to-morrow, my master comes to
      know this, in the morning he will chastise them with bull's-hide spoils.
      In fine, I care less for their backs than for my own. Much rather shall
      they be bull's-hide-scourged than I be rope-scourged {4}. (<i>Moves on.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter another</i> SERVANT.
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Hold you and stop this instant. Phaniscus! look round, I say!
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. (<i>not turning round</i>). Don't be annoying to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Do see how scornful the monkey is!
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. I am so for myself; I choose to be. Why do you trouble yourself about
      it? (<i>Walking on.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Are you going to stop this instant, you dirty parasite? PHA. (<i>turning
      round</i>). How am I a parasite?
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Why, I'll tell you: you can be drawn anywhere by victuals. Do you
      give yourself airs, because your master's so fond <i>of you</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. (<i>rubbing his eyes</i>). O dear, my eyes do ache {5}.
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. Because the smoke's <i>so</i> troublesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Hold your tongue, will you, <i>you clever</i> workman, who are in the
      habit of coining money out of lead {6}.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. You cannot compel me to be abusive to you. My master knows me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Why, really, his own pillow {7} he ought to know, <i>for resting on
      when drunk</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. If you were sober, you wouldn't be abusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Am I to give heed to you, when you won't to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. But, you rascal, you come along with me to fetch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Troth now, Phaniscus, prithee, do leave off talking about these
      matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. I'll do so, and knock at the door. (<i>Knocks at the door of the
      house of</i> THEUROPIDES.) Hallo there! is there any person here to
      protect this door from a most serious injury? (<i>Knocking again.</i>) Is
      any one, is any one, I say, coming out here and going to open it? Why,
      really, no one comes out here. Just as befits <i>such</i> worthless
      fellows, so they are. But on that account, I've the more need to be
      cautious that no one may come out and use me ill. (<i>They stand aside.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Well covered up</i>)&mdash;Ver. 865. He alludes to the
      practice of stripping disobedient slaves, for the purpose of flogging
      them.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Lavish of their property</i>)&mdash;Ver. 870. That is, of
      their backs.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>To pasturage out of doors</i>)&mdash;Ver. 876. This was
      probably a proverbial phrase for going to the "thermopolium," the "hot
      liquor-shop" or "tippling-house," so much frequented by the slaves. See
      the Trinummus, 1. 1013, and the Note to the passage.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>bull's-hide-scourged&mdash;rope-scourged</i>)&mdash;Ver.
      882. "Bucaedae&mdash;restio." The latter word properly signifies "a
      ropemaker." The former is probably coined by Plautus.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>My eyes do ache</i>)&mdash;Ver. 890. Phaniscus probably
      means to say, that the sight of him is as annoying to his eyes as smoke
      can be.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>Money out of lead</i>)&mdash;Ver. 892. According to
      Erasmus, (Adagia Chil. v. Cent. 1,) this was a proverbial expression among
      the Romans, signifying the ability to put on a specious appearance.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 7: <i>His own pillow</i>)&mdash;Ver. 894. There is an indelicate
      allusion in this line; and another turn has been given to it in the
      Translation.}

    </h2>
    <h3>
      TRA. What's your opinion of this bargain?
    </h3>
    <p>
      THEU. I am quite delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Does it seem to you to have been bought too dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I' faith, I'm sure that I never anywhere saw a house thrown away,
      this one only excepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Does it please you, <i>then</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Does it please me, do you ask me? Why yes, upon my faith, it really
      does please me very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What a fine set of rooms for the women! What a porch!
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Exceedingly fine. For my part, I don't think that there is any <i>porch</i>
      larger than this in the public buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why, I myself and Philolaches have taken the measure of all the
      porches in the public buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. <i>Well</i>, what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. <i>This</i> is far larger than all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Immortal Gods&mdash;a splendid bargain! On my word, if he were now
      to offer six great talents of silver, ready money, for it, I would never
      take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Upon my faith, if you were inclined to take it, I would never let
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. My money has been well invested upon this purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Boldly confess that by my advice and prompting it was done, who urged
      him to take up the money of the Banker upon interest, which we paid this
      person by way of deposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. You've saved the whole ship. Eighty minae {1}, you say, are owing
      for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Not a coin more. THEU. He may have it to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. By all means so, that there may be no dispute arising; or else pay
      them over to me, I'll then pay them over to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. But still, don't let there be any taking me in, if I do give them to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Could I venture to deceive you in deed or word even in jest only?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Could I venture not to be on my guard against you, so as not to
      trust anything to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why, have I ever imposed upon you in anything, since I was your <i>servant</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. But I've taken good care <i>of that</i>; I owe thanks to myself and
      my own judgment for that. If I'm only on my guard against you solely, I'm
      quite wise enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>aside</i>). I agree with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Now be off into the country; tell my son that I've arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I'll do as you wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEIU. Run with all speed; bid him come to the city at once together with
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Very well. (<i>Aside.</i>) Now I'll betake myself this way by the
      back-door to my boon-companions; I'll tell them that things are quiet
      here, and how I have kept him away from here. (<i>Exit.</i>

      are a decent lad.

      PHA. Doesn't a young gentleman <i>called</i> Philolaches live in this
      house?

    <p>
      SER. (<i>aside</i>). This old fellow's crack-brained, surely.

      from here to-day or yesterday, I know for certain that he's living here.

      and drinking have never ceased for a single three days here.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What is it you say?

      truth in this. I'll continue to question him still. Do you say that this
      Philolaches, whoever he is, has been in the habit of drinking here

      enough.

      other persons' houses.

      Philolaches lives here, whose father is Theuropides; and who, after his
      father went away to trade, made free a music-girl here.

    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Do you say that a mistress was purchased for Philolaches for thirty
      minae?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. I do say so. THEU. And that he gave her her freedom?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. I do say so. THEU. And that after his father had departed hence
      abroad, he has been carousing here continually with your master?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. I do say <i>so</i>. THEU. Well, has he made purchase of the house
      next door here?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. I don't say <i>so</i>. THEU. Has he given forty minae, too, to this
      person, to be as a deposit?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. Nor yet do I say <i>so</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Ah me! you've proved my ruin!
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. Aye, and he has proved the ruin of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. You prophesy the truth! I could wish it false!
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. A friend of his father, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Ah me! Upon my faith, you do pronounce him <i>to be</i> a wretched
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. Why really, this is nothing at all&mdash;thirty minae, in comparison
      with the other expenses he has incurred in good living. He has ruined his
      father. There's one servant there, a very great scoundrel, Tranio <i>by
      name</i>; he could even waste the revenue of a Hercules {4}. On my word,
      I'm sadly distrest for his father; for when he comes to know that things
      have gone on thus, a hot coal will be scorching his breast, poor man.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. If, indeed, this is the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. What am I to gain, that I should tell a lie? (<i>Knocks again at the
      door.</i>) Hallo, you! is any one coming to open this <i>door</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      SER. Why do you knock in this way, when there's no one in the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. I fancy that he's gone elsewhere to carouse. Now then, let's begone.
      (<i>They move as if going.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What, <i>my</i> lad, are you off then? Liberty's the overcoat for
      your back {5}.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHA. Nothing have I with which to cover my back, except to pay respect and
      service to my master.

    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to himself</i>). By my troth, I am undone! What need is there of
      talking? According to the words I have heard, I surely haven't lately
      voyaged hence to Aegypt, but even to some desolate land and the most
      remote shores have I been borne about, so much am I at a loss to know
      where I now am. But I shall soon know; for see, here's the person of whom
      my son bought the house.

      THEU. Has anything new been going on at the Forum to-day?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Why yes. THEU. What is it, pray?

    <p>
      SIM. I saw a dead man being carried to burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Dear me! that is something new!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. I saw one who was dead being carried out to burial {1}. They said
      that he had been alive but just before.

    <p>
      THEU. Woe to that head of yours <i>for your nonsense</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Why are you, <i>thus</i> idling about, enquiring after the news?
      THEU. Because I've just arrived from abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. I'm engaged out to dine: don't suppose I shall invite you {2}. THEU.
      I' faith, I don't want.

      SIM. But, to-morrow, unless any person invites me first, I'll even dine
      with you.

      THEU. I' faith, and that, too, I don't want. Unless you are engaged <i>with
      something</i> of greater importance, lend me your attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. By all means. THEU. You have received, as far as I understand, forty
      minae of Philolaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Never a coin, so far as I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What? <i>Not</i> from my servant Tranio?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Much less <i>is</i> that <i>the case</i>.

    <p>
      THEU. Which he gave you by way of deposit?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. What are you dreaming about?

    <p>
      THEU. What, I? Why, really, 'tis yourself, who hope that, by dissembling
      in this manner, you'll be able to make void this bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Why, what <i>do you mean</i>? THEU. The business that, in my absence,
      my son transacted with you here.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. How did your son, in your absence, transact any business with me?
      What pray, or on what day?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I owe you eighty minae of silver.

      them, give them me. Faith must be kept. Don't be attempting to deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Assuredly, I shall not deny that I owe them; and I shall pay them.
      Do you take care how you deny that you received the forty from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. Troth now, prithee, look this way at me, and answer me. He said that
      you were wishful to give a wife to your son; for that reason, he said that
      you intended building on your own <i>premises</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I, intended building here? SIM. So he told me.
    </p>

      Neighbours, I'm undone, ruined quite!

    <p>
      SIM. Has Tranio been causing any confusion?

    <p>
      THEU. Yes; he has thrown everything into confusion. He has made a fool of
      me to-day in a disgraceful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. What is it you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. This matter is just as I am telling you; he has this day made a fool
      of me in an outrageous manner. Now I beseech you that you'll kindly aid
      me, and lend me your assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIM. What would you have?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I beg of you, come this way together with me.

    <p>
      SIM. Be it so. THEU. Lend me the assistance of your slaves and some
      scourges.

      SIM. Take them <i>by all means</i>.

      this day imposed upon me. (<i>They go into the house of</i> SIMO.)

    <h3>
      <i>Enter</i> TRANIO.
    </h3>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>to himself</i>). The man that shall prove timid in critical
      matters, will not be worth a nutshell. And, really, to say what that
      expression, "worth a nutshell," means, I don't know. But after my master
      sent me into the country to fetch his son hither, I went that way (<i>pointing</i>)
      slily through the lane to our garden. At the entrance to the garden that's
      in the lane, I opened the door; and by that road I led out all the troop,
      both men and women. After, from being in a state of siege, I had led out
      my troops to a place of safety, I
    </p>
    <p>
      adopted the plan of convoking a senate of my comrades, and when I had
      convoked it, they forthwith banished me from the senate. When I myself
      perceived that the matter must be decided by my own judgment, as soon as
      ever I could, I did the same as many others do, whose affairs are in a
      critical or a perplexed state; they proceed to render them more perplexed,
      so that nothing can be settled. But I know full well, that now by no means
      can this be concealed from the old man. But how's this, that our next
      neighbour's door makes a noise? Why, surely this is my master: I'd like to
      have a taste of his talk. (<i>Goes aside, out of sight of</i>
      THEUROPIDES.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter</i> THEUROPIDES, <i>from</i> SIMO'S <i>house.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>in the doorway, speaking to</i> SIMO'S SLAVES). Do you stand
      there, in that spot within the threshold; so that, the very instant I
      call, you may sally forth at once. Quickly fasten the handcuffs <i>upon
      him</i>. I'll wait before the house for this fellow that makes a fool of
      me, whose hide I'll make a fool of in fine style, if I live.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>apart</i>). The affair's all out. Now it's best for you, Tranio,
      to consider what you are to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to himself</i>). I must go to work to catch him cleverly and
      artfully when he comes here. I'll not disclose to him my feelings all at
      once; I'll throw out my line; I'll conceal the fact that I know anything
      of these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>apart</i>). O cunning mortal! not another person in Athens can be
      pronounced more clever than he. One can no more this day deceive him than
      <i>he can</i> a stone. I'll accost the man; I'll address him.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. (<i>to himself</i>). Now I do wish that he would come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. (<i>apart</i>). I' faith, if me indeed you want, here I am ready at
      hand for you. (<i>Comes forward.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Bravo! Tranio, what's being done?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. The country people are coming from the country: Philolaches will be
      here in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I' faith, he comes opportunely for me. This neighbour of ours I take
      to be a shameless and dishonest fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Inasmuch as he denies that he knows you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Denies it? THEU. <i>And declares</i> that you never gave him a single
      coin of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Out with you, you are joking me, I do believe; he doesn't deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. How so? TRA. I am sure now that you are joking; for surely he
      doesn't deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Nay but, upon my faith, he really does deny it; or that he has sold
      this house to Philolaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Well now, pray, has he denied that the money was paid him?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Nay more, he offered to take an oath to me, if I desired it, that he
      had neither sold this house, nor had <i>any</i> money him paid been. I
      told him the same <i>that you told me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What did he say? THEU. He offered to give up all his servants for
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Nonsense! On my faith, he never will give them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. He really does offer <i>them</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why then, do you summon him to trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Wait a bit; I'll make trial as I fancy. I'm determined on it. TRA.
      Bring the fellow here to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What then, if I go fetch some men?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. It ought to hare been done already; or else bid the young man to
      demand possession of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Why no, I want <i>to do</i> this first&mdash;to put the servants
      under examination {1}.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I' faith, I think it ought to be done. Meantime, I'll take possession
      of this altar {2}. (<i>Runs to the altar.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Why so? TRA. You can understand nothing. Why, that those may not be
      able to take refuge here whom he shall give up for examination, I'll keep
      guard here for you; so that the examination may not come to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Get up <i>from the altar</i>. TRA. By no means.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Prithee, don't you take possession of the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. You shall hear; why, because I especially want this, for them to be
      taking refuge there. Do let <i>them</i>; so much the more easily shall I
      get him fined before the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What you intend to do, do it. Why do you wish to sow further strife?
      You don't know how ticklish a thing it is to go to law.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Just get up, (<i>beckoning</i>) this way; it's, then, to ask your
      advice upon something <i>that I want you</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Still, as I am, I'll give my advice from this spot; my wits are much
      sharper when I'm sitting {3}. Besides, advice is given with higher
      sanction from holy places {4}.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Get up; don't be trifling. Just look me in the face. TRA. (<i>looking
      at him</i>). I am looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Do you see me? TRA. I do see&mdash;that if any third person were to
      step in here, he would die of hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Why so? TRA. Because he would get no profit; for, upon my faith, we
      are both artful ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I'm undone! TRA. What's the matter with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. You have deceived me. TRA. How so, pray?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. You've wiped me clean {5}. TRA. Consider, please, if it wasn't well
      done; is your nose running <i>still</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Aye, all my brains besides have you been wiping out of my head as
      well. For all your villanies I have discovered from their very roots; and
      not from the roots, indeed, i' faith, but even from beneath the very
      roots. Never this day, by my troth, will you have planned <i>all this</i>
      without being punished. I shall at once, you villain, order fire and
      faggots {6} to be placed around you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Don't do it; for it's my way to be sweeter boiled than roasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Upon my faith, I'll make an example of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Because I please you, you select me for an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Say <i>now</i>: what kind of a person did I leave my son, when I
      went away from here?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. <i>One</i> with feet <i>and</i> hands, with fingers, ears, eyes, <i>and</i>
      lips. THEU. I asked you something else <i>than that</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. For that reason I now answer you something else. But look, I see
      Callidamates, the friend of your son, coming this way. Deal with me in his
      presence, if you want anything.

      Romans for extracting confessions from slaves.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Take position of this altar</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1074. When a
      person took refuge at an altar, he could not be brought to justice, or
      have violence offered to his person. According to some writers, there were
      always two altars on the stage of Comedy, one on the right hand, sacred to
      Apollo, and one on the left, devoted to that Divinity or Hero in honor of
      whom the Play was being acted.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>Sharper when I'm sitting</i>)&mdash;1083. Warner suggests
      that a little raillery is intended here, upon the custom of sitting when
      dispensing justice and paying adoration to the Gods.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>With higher sanction from holy places</i>)&mdash;Ver.
      1084. The ancients made use of sacred places for the purpose of debating
      on affairs of importance in, as being likely to add weight and authority
      to their judgment. The Roman Senate often met in the Temples, and there
      administered justice and gate audience to ambassadors.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 5: <i>You've wiped me clean</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1089. "Emungo," "to
      wipe the nose" for a person, also meant "to cheat" or "impose upon him;"
      probably, by reason of the state of helplessness it implied in the party
      who was so treated.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 6: <i>Order fire and faggots</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1099. Though a

    <h2>
      SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Enter CALLIDAMATES, at a distance.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      CALL. (<i>to himself</i>). When I had buried all drowsiness {1}, and slept
      off the debauch, Philolaches told me that <i>his</i> father had arrived
      here from abroad; in what a way too <i>his</i> servant had imposed upon
      the man on his arrival; he said that he was afraid to come into his
      presence. Now of our company I am deputed sole ambassador, to obtain peace
      from his father. And look, most opportunely here he is. (<i>Accosting</i>
      THEUROPIDES.) I wish you health, Theuropides, and am glad that you've got
      back safe from abroad. You must dine here with us to-day. Do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Callidamates, may the Gods bless you. For your dinner I offer you my
      thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Will you come then? TRA. (<i>To</i> THEUROPIDES.) Do promise him;
      I'll go for you, if you don't like.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Whip-scoundrel, laughing at <i>me</i> still?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. What, because I say that I'll go to dinner for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. But you shan't go. I'll have you carried to the cross, as you
      deserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Come, let this pass, and say that I shall go to the dinner. Why are
      you silent?
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. (<i>to</i> TRANIO). But why, you greatest of simpletons, have you
      taken refuge at the altar?
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. He frightened me on his arrival. (<i>To</i> THEUROPIDES.) Say now,
      what I have done <i>amiss</i>. Look, now there's an umpire for us both;
      come, discuss <i>the matter</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I say that you have corrupted my son.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Only listen. I confess that he has done amiss; that he has given
      freedom to his mistress; that in your absence he has borrowed money at
      interest; that, I admit, is squandered away. Has he done anything
      different to what sons of the noblest families do?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Upon my faith, I must be on my guard with you; you are too clever a
      pleader.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Just let me be umpire in this matter. (<i>To</i> TRANIO.) Get up;
      I'll seat myself there.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. By all means: take the management of this dispute to yourself. (<i>Pushes
      him to one side of the altar.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why, this is <i>surely</i> a trick. Make me, then, not to be in a
      fright, and yourself to be in a fright in my stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I consider now everything of trifling consequence, compared with the
      way in which he has fooled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. I' faith, 'twas cleverly done, and I rejoice that it was done. Those
      who have white heads ought at that age to be wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. What am I now to do if my friend Demipho or Philonides&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Tell them in what way your servant made a fool of you. You would be
      affording most capital plots for Comedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Hold your tongue awhile; let me speak in my turn.&mdash;Listen.
      THEU. By all means.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. In the first place of all then, you know that I am the companion of
      your son; he has gone to my house, for he is ashamed to come into your
      presence, because he knows that you are aware what he has done. Now, I
      beseech you, do pardon his simplicity and youthfulness. He is your <i>son</i>;
      you know that this age is wont to play such pranks; whatever he has done,
      he has done in company with me. We have acted wrong: the interest,
      principal, and all the sum at which the mistress vas purchased, all of it
      we will find, <i>and</i> will contribute together, at our own cost, not
      yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. No mediator could have come to me more able to influence me than
      yourself. I am neither angry with him {2}, nor do I blame him for
      anything: nay more, in my presence, wench on, drink, do what you please.
      If he's ashamed of this, that he has been extravagant, I have sufficient
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. I'm quite ashamed <i>myself</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. He grants pardon thus far; now then, what is to become of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Filth, tied up as you hang, you shall be beaten with stripes.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Even though I am ashamed {3}?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Upon my faith, I'll be the death of you, if I live!
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Make this pardon general; do, pray, forgive Tranio this offence, for
      my sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I would more readily put up with your obtaining any other request of
      me than that I should forbear sending to perdition this fellow for his
      most villanous doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Pray, do pardon him. TRA. Do pardon me?
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Look there, don't you see how the villain sticks there? (<i>Pointing
      to the altar.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Tranio, do be quiet, if you are in your senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Only do you be quiet in urging this matter. I'll subdue him with
      stripes, so that he shall be quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Really, there is no need. Come now, do allow yourself to be
      prevailed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I wish you would not request me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Troth now, I do entreat you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. I wish you would not request me, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. It's in vain you wish me not; only do grant this one pardon for his
      offence, pray, for my sake, I do entreat you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TRA. Why make this difficulty? As if to-morrow, I shouldn't be very soon
      committing some other fault; then, both of them, both this one and that,
      you'll be able to punish soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      CALL. Do let me prevail upon you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEU. Well then, have it <i>so</i>; begone, unpunished! (TRANIO <i>jumps
      down from the altar.</i>) There now, (<i>pointing to</i> CALLIDAMATES)
      return him thanks for it. (<i>Coming forward.</i>) Spectators, this Play
      is finished; grant <i>us your</i> applause {4}.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: <i>Buried all drowsiness</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1102. Generally we
      hear of a person "being buried in sleep;" but Callidamates considers that
      a drunkard, when he awakes from his sleep, "buries slumber." It is not
      unlike the words of Shakspeare, in Macbeth: "Macbeth doth murder sleep!"}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 2: <i>Neither angry with him</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1142. "Illi," "with
      him;" evidently meaning Philolaches.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 3: <i>Though I am ashamed</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1146. This piece of
      impudence is very characteristic of Tranio.}
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 4: <i>Grant us your applause</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1160. We may here
      remark that The Intriguing Chambermaid, one of Fielding's Comedies, is
      founded upon this entertaining Play.}

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
